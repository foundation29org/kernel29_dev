    "predict_diagnosis": "Step 1: The patient's symptoms of abnormality of refraction and visual loss can be attributed to various medical conditions, including genetic disorders, developmental delays, and acquired conditions such as stroke or traumatic brain injury.\nStep 2: The patient's café-au-lait spots and cranial hyperostosis are consistent with a rare genetic disorder called neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1).\nStep 3: The patient's large café-au-lait macules with irregular margins and polyostotic fibrous dysplasia are also consistent with NF1.\nStep 4: The patient's abnormal shape of the occiput can be indicative of a rare genetic disorder called craniosynostosis.\nStep 5: The patient's visual loss can be attributed to various causes, including retinal detachment, retinal vein occlusion, and optic neuritis.\nStep 6: The patient's abnormality of refraction can be attributed to various causes, including myopia, hyperopia, astigmatism, and presbyopia.\nStep 7: The patient's cafe-au-lait spots and cranial hyperostosis are consistent with a rare genetic disorder called neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1).\nStep 8: The patient's large café-au-lait macules with irregular margins and polyostotic fibrous dysplasia are also consistent with NF1.\nStep 9: The patient's abnormal shape of the occiput can be indicative of a rare genetic disorder called craniosynostosis.\nStep 10: The patient's visual loss can be attributed to various causes, including retinal detachment, retinal vein occlusion, and optic neuritis.\nTherefore, the final diagnosis is [Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)/Café-au-lait spot, cranial hyperostosis,Polyostotic fibrous dysplasia,Abnormal shape of the occiput,Craniosynostosis,Retinal detachment,Retinal vein occlusion,Optic neuritis].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
