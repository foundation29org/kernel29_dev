    "predict_diagnosis": "Step 1: The patient's symptoms of trismus, hyperhidrosis, syncope, vomiting, loss of consciousness, and right bundle branch block can be attributed to various medical conditions.\nStep 2: The patient's electrocardiogram (ECG) results indicate right bundle branch block, which can be indicative of a cardiac disease.\nStep 3: The patient's symptoms of trismus and hyperhidrosis can be attributed to a neurological disorder, such as trigeminal neuralgia or hyperhidrosis.\nStep 4: The patient's syncope and loss of consciousness can be attributed to a cardiac disease, such as arrhythmia or heart failure, or a neurological disorder, such as seizures or stroke.\nStep 5: The patient's vomiting can be attributed to a gastrointestinal disorder, such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).\nStep 6: The patient's right bundle branch block on the ECG can indicate a risk of cardiac arrhythmias, which can be caused by various medical conditions, including cardiomyopathy, coronary artery disease, or long QT syndrome.\nStep 7: The patient's trismus can be attributed to a musculoskeletal disorder, such as temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorder or osteoporosis.\nStep 8: The patient's hyperhidrosis can be attributed to a endocrine disorder, such as hyperthyroidism or hypoparathyroidism.\nStep 9: The patient's loss of consciousness can be attributed to a neurological disorder, such as seizures or stroke, or a cardiac disease, such as arrhythmia or heart failure.\nStep 10: The patient's top 10 diagnoses are:\n1.
