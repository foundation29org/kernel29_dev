It is essential to perform thorough clinical assessments, laboratory tests, and imaging studies to establish the definitive diagnosis. The presence of multiple organ involvements suggests a systemic disorder, and a multidisciplinary approach is crucial for accurate diagnosis and appropriate management.",
