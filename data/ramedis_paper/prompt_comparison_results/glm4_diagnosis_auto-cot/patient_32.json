    "predict_diagnosis": "1. **Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)**\n   - Characterized by upper and lower limb muscle weakness, spastic gait, hyperactive deep tendon reflexes, and Babinski sign.\n\n2. **Primary Progressive Aphasia (PPA)**\n   - Coma, dysarthria, anarthria, and sleep disturbance can be present in PPA, which is a progressive language disorder.\n\n3. **Multiple Sclerosis (MS)**\n   - Morphological abnormality of the pyramidal tract, spastic gait, and difficulty walking can be indicative of MS, particularly with upper limb weakness and hyperactive reflexes.\n\n4. **Spinal Cord Injury or Disease**\n   - Could present with spastic gait, difficulty walking, hyperactive deep tendon reflexes, and Babinski sign.\n\n5. **Spinocerebellar Ataxia**\n   - Upper limb muscle weakness, difficulty climbing stairs, and dysarthria can be seen in spinocerebellar ataxias.\n\n6. **Motor Neurone Disease (MND)**\n   - Similar to ALS, but with a broader spectrum of presentations, including upper limb amyotrophy and hyperactive reflexes.\n\n7. **Friedreich's Ataxia**\n   - Can present with gait abnormalities, upper limb weakness, and hypertonia, as well as other systemic features like diabetes and heart disease.\n\n8. **Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia (HSP)**\n   - Characterized by progressive lower limb spasticity, hyperactive reflexes, and Babinski sign.\n\n9. **Corticobasal Degeneration (CBD)**\n   - Can present with limb apraxia, rigidity, and dystonia, as well as cognitive and behavioral changes.\n\n10. **Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD)**\n    - Coma, sleep disturbance, and changes in behavior can be seen in FTD, which can also present with motor symptoms similar to ALS.\n\nThese diagnoses represent a diverse range of conditions that could present with the given phenotype. Each would require further clinical and possibly neuroimaging or genetic testing to confirm.",
