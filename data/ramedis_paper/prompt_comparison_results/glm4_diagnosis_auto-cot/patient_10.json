    "predict_diagnosis": "1. **McCune-Albright Syndrome (MAS):** Characterized by polyostotic fibrous dysplasia, cafe-au-lait spots, and endocrine disorders, which could include early puberty and abnormal breast development.\n2. **Hyperophic Osteodystrophy (HOD)/Caffey Disease:** Involves abnormal bone growth and can present with bone pain, fractures, and abnormal bone morphology.\n3. **Gardner Syndrome:** A variant of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) with extracolonic manifestations, including bone and soft tissue tumors, and cafe-au-lait spots.\n4. **Cowden Syndrome:** Features include multiple hamartomas, cafe-au-lait spots, and an increased risk of breast, thyroid, and endometrial cancer, which could present with metrorrhagia.\n5. **Marfan Syndrome:** Can involve skeletal, ophthalmic (conjunctivitis), and cardiovascular abnormalities, including gait disturbances and bone pain.\n6. **Turner Syndrome:** In females, it can present with a webbed neck, abnormal vagina and mandible, and hearing impairment, along with other endocrine abnormalities.\n7. **Lynch Syndrome (also known as Hereditary Nonpolyposis Colorectal Cancer):** Can be associated with gynecological malignancies and may present with metrorrhagia and fibrous dysplasia.\n8. **Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 1 (MEN1):** Characterized by tumors of the parathyroid, pancreas, and pituitary, which could lead to bone pain and fibrous dysplasia.\n9. **Juvenile Pilocytic Astrocytoma (JPA):** Sometimes associated with endocrine abnormalities and can present with cafe-au-lait spots and bone pain.\n10. **Rothmund-Thomson Syndrome:** Features include poikiloderma, cafe-au-lait spots, and bone dysplasia, which could lead to fractures and bone pain.\n\nEach of these conditions shares some of the clinical features listed in the patient's phenotype, but the combination of symptoms suggests a systemic disorder with both skeletal and endocrine involvement. A precise diagnosis would require a thorough clinical evaluation, including genetic testing, imaging studies, and endocrine function tests.",
