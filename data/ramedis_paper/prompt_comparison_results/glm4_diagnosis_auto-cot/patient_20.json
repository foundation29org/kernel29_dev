    "predict_diagnosis": "1. **Primary Cardiomyopathy (Dilated Cardiomyopathy):** Given the presence of cardiomegaly, dilated cardiomyopathy, reduced systolic function, and right ventricular failure, this is a primary consideration.\n2. **Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy (ARVC):** The abnormal tricuspid valve morphology, right ventricular dilatation, and paroxysmal ventricular tachycardia suggest this diagnosis.\n3. **Hyperlipidemia-Induced Cardiac Disease:** Hyperlipidemia can contribute to the development of cardiomyopathy and the associated symptoms of exertional dyspnea and weight loss.\n4. **Uterine Leiomyoma-Associated Cardiac Dysfunction:** Large uterine fibroids can lead to compression of blood vessels and the heart, causing symptoms like syncope and cardiomegaly.\n5. **Heart Valve Disease (Tricuspid Valve Dysfunction):** The abnormal tricuspid valve morphology could be causing right heart chamber enlargement and related symptoms.\n6. **Cardiac Amyloidosis:** This can present with cardiomegaly, heart failure, and arrhythmias, and may be associated with weight loss and poor appetite.\n7. **Sarcoidosis:** This systemic granulomatous disease can affect the heart, leading to cardiomegaly, arrhythmias, and elevated pulmonary artery pressure.\n8. **Endocarditis:** Given the presence of valvular abnormalities and systemic symptoms like fever and weight loss, this infection of the heart's inner lining is a possibility.\n9. **Anemia-Related Cardiac Dysfunction:** Given the nonproductive cough and decreased urine output, anemia-related heart issues could be contributing to the symptoms.\n10. **Mitochondrial Disease:** These disorders can affect multiple organ systems, including the heart, and can lead to symptoms like muscle weakness, cardiomegaly, and arrhythmias.\n\nEach of these diagnoses represents a unique possibility based on the patient's phenotype, and further diagnostic testing would be necessary to confirm the exact cause of the patient's symptoms.",
