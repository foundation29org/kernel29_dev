    "predict_diagnosis": "1. **Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS):** Characterized by neonatal hypotonia, developmental delays, cognitive impairment, and compulsive behaviors, often with a concurrent increase in body weight due to hyperphagia.\n2. **Angelman Syndrome (AS):** Presents with delayed speech and language development, neonatal hypotonia, and can include features like slurred speech, poor suck, and an abnormal stomach morphology.\n3. **Rett Syndrome:** Can involve developmental regression, including speech and motor skills, hypotonia, and compulsive hand-wringing or other repetitive behaviors.\n4. **Down Syndrome:** Often associated with delayed speech and language development, hypotonia, and growth retardation, as well as an increased risk of aspiration pneumonia.\n5. **Metabolic Disorders (e.g., Maple Syrup Urine Disease):** Can lead to neonatal hypotonia, developmental delays, and elevated hemoglobin A1c due to altered metabolism.\n6. **Fragile X Syndrome:** Features can include delayed speech and language development, hypotonia, and cognitive impairments, with a range of behavioral issues including compulsivity.\n7. **Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) with Intellectual Disability:** Can present with delayed speech and language development, repetitive behaviors, and in some cases, neonatal hypotonia.\n8. **Mitochondrial Disease:** A diverse group of disorders that can lead to a range of symptoms including hypotonia, developmental delays, and poor suck, with possible complications like aspiration pneumonia.\n9. **Cerebral Palsy (CP):** Can result from perinatal factors like preterm birth and intraventricular hemorrhage, leading to motor and speech delays, hypotonia, and in some cases, cognitive impairment.\n10. **Gastrointestinal Disorders (e.g., Hirschsprung Disease):** Could present with an abnormal stomach morphology, poor suck, and growth retardation, which could be associated with systemic issues causing other symptoms.\n\nEach of these conditions could potentially present with a combination of the symptoms described in the patient's phenotype. However, it is important to note that many rare diseases can have overlapping features, and a precise diagnosis often requires a combination of clinical examination, medical history, laboratory testing, and sometimes genetic testing.",
