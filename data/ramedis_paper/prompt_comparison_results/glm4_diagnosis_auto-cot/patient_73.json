    "predict_diagnosis": "1. **Fahr's Disease (Familial Dysautonomia)**: Given the combination of intellectual disability, seizures, tetany, gait disturbance, and abnormal medulla oblongata morphology, which can be seen in this hereditary neuropathy.\n2. **Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC)**: This genetic disorder can present with intellectual disability, seizures, gait disturbance, and abnormal cerebral white matter morphology, along with other possible features like talipes.\n3. **Mitochondrial Disease**: The diverse symptoms, including intellectual disability, seizures, gait disturbance, and drooling, can be indicative of a mitochondrial encephalopathy.\n4. **Sturge-Weber Syndrome**: Characterized by facial port-wine stains, seizures, intellectual disability, and abnormal cerebral white matter, which could present with slurred speech and memory impairment.\n5. **Ataxia-Telangiectasia**: Known for causing progressive neurodegeneration, immunodeficiency, and cancer susceptibility, it can present with gait disturbance, intellectual disability, and seizures.\n6. **Rett Syndrome**: A neurodevelopmental disorder that can cause intellectual disability, gait abnormalities, loss of purposeful hand movements, and progressive language deterioration.\n7. **Kearns-Sayre Syndrome**: A mitochondrial encephalomyopathy that can lead to intellectual disability, seizures, dysarthria, and abnormal lung morphology.\n8. **Lesch-Nyhan Syndrome**: A rare genetic disorder that can cause intellectual disability, gait disturbance, dysarthria, and chorea, along with compulsive self-biting and other behavioral issues.\n9. **Holoprosencephaly**: A malformation of the brain that can result in intellectual disability, seizures, facial anomalies, and gait abnormalities.\n10. **Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD)**: Although typically seen in older individuals, FTD can present with progressive language deterioration, memory impairment, and behavioral changes, which could be seen in an atypical juvenile form.\n\nEach of these diagnoses represents a unique possibility given the patient's complex phenotype. A thorough clinical evaluation, including detailed family history, genetic testing, and neuroimaging, would be necessary to narrow down the diagnosis.",
