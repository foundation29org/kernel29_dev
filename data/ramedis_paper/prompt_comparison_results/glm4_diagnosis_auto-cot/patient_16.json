    "predict_diagnosis": "1. **Congenital Kyphoscoliosis**: Caused by vertebral anomalies present at birth.\n2. **Juvenile Idiopathic Scoliosis**: A form of scoliosis that presents in children and can progress to include kyphosis.\n3. **Marfan Syndrome**: A genetic disorder that can affect the connective tissue, leading to kyphoscoliosis.\n4. **Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome**: A group of genetic disorders that affect connective tissue, potentially causing joint hypermobility and spinal curvature.\n5. **Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy**: A genetic disorder leading to progressive muscle weakness, often resulting in scoliosis and kyphosis.\n6. **Scheuermann's Disease**: A developmental disorder of the vertebral column causing kyphosis, which can be associated with scoliosis.\n7. **Ankylosing Spondylitis**: An inflammatory arthritis that can lead to ankylosis and deformities of the spine, including kyphoscoliosis.\n8. **Neuromuscular Conditions (e.g., Spinal Muscular Atrophy)**: Disorders affecting the nerves and muscles can lead to weakness and deformities of the spine.\n9. **Osteoporosis with Vertebral Compression Fractures**: Severe osteoporosis can result in multiple vertebral compression fractures, causing a combination of kyphosis and scoliosis.\n10. **Familial Thoracic Insufficiency Syndrome**: A rare disorder characterized by abnormal development of the thoracic cage, leading to scoliosis and/or kyphosis.\n\nEach of these conditions represents a unique pathophysiology and has distinct characteristics that may present with kyphoscoliosis. A thorough clinical evaluation, including medical history, physical examination, imaging studies, and possibly genetic testing, would be necessary to determine the precise diagnosis.",
