    "predict_diagnosis": "1. Fragile X syndrome: This is an inherited disorder characterized by fragile X chromosomes that can lead to a variety of clinical findings, including developmental delays, learning difficulties, and behavior problems.\n\n2. Rett syndrome: This is another genetic disorder that can cause developmental delays, language impairments, and repetitive behaviors.\n\n3. Phenylketonuria (PKU): This is an inherited disorder that results from a deficiency in phenylalanine hydroxylase, an enzyme that converts phenylalanine to tyrosine, a key step in the metabolism of proteins. This leads to a buildup of phenylalanine, which can cause damage to the brain and other organs.\n\n4. Lesch Nyhan syndrome: This is a rare genetic disorder that affects the brain and eyes, causing developmental delays, intellectual disabilities, and abnormalities of the eyelids and iris.\n\n5. Cornflower syndrome: Also known as tumerator syndrome, this is a rare genetic disorder that affects the brain and eyes, causing developmental delays, intellectual disabilities, and abnormalities of the eyelids and iris.\n\n6. Fucosidosis: This is an inherited disorder that results from a deficiency in the enzyme fucosidase, which is responsible for breaking down fucose, a sugar found in many fruits and vegetables. This leads to a buildup of fucose, which can cause damage to the brain and other organs.\n\n7. Waardenberg syndrome: This is a rare genetic disorder that affects the skin, eyes, and brain, causing developmental delays, intellectual disabilities, and abnormalities of the scalp and hair.\n\n8. Costeff syndrome: This is a rare genetic disorder that affects the brain and ears, causing developmental delays, intellectual disabilities, and hearing impairments.\n\n9. Mucolipidosis: This is an inherited disorder that results from a deficiency in the enzyme lipase, which is responsible for breaking down fats. This leads to a buildup of lipids, which can cause damage to the liver and other organs.\n\n10. Gaucher disease: This is an inherited disorder that affects the brain and bone marrow, causing developmental delays, intellectual disabilities, and bone deformities.",
