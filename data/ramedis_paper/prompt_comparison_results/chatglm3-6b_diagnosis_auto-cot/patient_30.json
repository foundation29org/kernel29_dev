    "predict_diagnosis": "1. Hemangioma: a rare tumor that forms from the abnormal proliferation of blood vessels.\n2. Spastic paraplegia: a neurological disorder characterized by muscle weakness and stiffness.\n3. Difficulty walking: could be caused by various factors such as mobility issues or神经障碍.\n4. EMG: neuropathic changes: could indicate a neurodegenerative disease or injury.\n5. Babinski sign: a test used to assess neurological function, it can indicate issues with motor neurons.\n6. Difficulty standing: could be caused by mobility issues or神经障碍.\n7. Decreased finger mobility: could be a sign of a neurodegenerative disease or injury.\n8. Hyperactive deep tendon reflexes: could indicate a neurodegenerative disease or injury.\n9. Lower limb muscle weakness: could be caused by a variety of disorders such as neuropathy or muscle disease.\n10. Abasia: a neurological disorder characterized by abnormal muscle tone and posture.\n\nIt is important to note that this list is not exhaustive and other possibilities such as infections or metabolic disorders should also be considered. A thorough medical history and physical examination, along with diagnostic testing, will be necessary to determine the specific diagnosis.",
