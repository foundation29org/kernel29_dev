    "predict_diagnosis": "   1. Gitelman Syndrome (GS): A genetic disorder affecting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), causing renal tubular dysfunction, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and symptoms including oral ulcer, syncope, palpitations, diarrhea, dyspnea, and generalized muscle weakness.\n2. Hyperkalemia: An abnormally high level of potassium in the bloodstream, which can cause heart arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and syncope.\n3. Hypomagnesemia: A low level of magnesium in the bloodstream, which can cause muscle weakness, syncope, and heart arrhythmias.\n4. Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC): A genetic disorder affecting the right ventricle of the heart, causing arrhythmias, heart failure, and symptoms including oral ulcer, palpitations, and dyspnea.\n5. Long QT syndrome: A genetic disorder affecting the heart's electrical system, causing heart arrhythmias and symptoms including palpitations, syncope, and dyspnea.\n6. Primary hyperparathyroidism: A condition caused by a problem with the parathyroid glands, which release a hormone that helps the body absorb calcium. Symptoms can include oral ulcer, abdominal pain, and dyspnea.\n7. Hypotension: A low blood pressure, which can cause dizziness, syncope, and muscle weakness.\n8. Liver disease: An abnormality in liver function, which can cause symptoms including dysesthesia, amaurosis fugax, and abnormality of urine calcium concentration.\n9. Muscle dystrophy: A genetic disorder affecting muscle tissue, causing weakness, weakness of the lower limbs, and dyspnea.\n10. Kidney disease: An abnormality in kidney function, which can cause symptoms including oral ulcer, syncope, and hyponatremia.",
