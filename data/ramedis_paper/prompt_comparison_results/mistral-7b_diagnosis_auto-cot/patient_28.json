    "predict_diagnosis": "   1. Sickle cell disease: This is a genetic disorder that affects the shape of red blood cells and can lead to a variety of symptoms, including nephrolithiasis, hepatomegaly, and pulmonary arterial hypertension.\n2. Hemochromatosis: This is a condition where the body absorbs too much iron from food and stores it in organs, leading to iron overload. Iron overload can cause cardiomyopathy, liver disease, and pulmonary damage.\n3. Cardiac amyloidosis: This is a disorder where proteins accumulate in the heart muscle, leading to ventricular dysfunction and conduction disturbances.\n4. Atrial fibrillation with thromboembolism: This is a condition where the atrium of the heart beats irregularly, causing blood clots to form and potentially travel to the brain, leading to stroke and other complications.\n5. Hypertensive heart disease: This is a condition where high blood pressure causes damage to the heart and its vessels, leading to left ventricular hypertrophy and decreased ejection fraction.\n6. Tricuspid valve disease: This is a condition where the tricuspid valve in the heart is damaged, leading to regurgitation and dyspnea.\n7. Regional wall motion abnormality: This is a term used to describe areas of the heart muscle that do not contract properly, which can be caused by a variety of underlying conditions such as myocardial ischemia, inflammation, or infiltrative disease.\n8. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD): This is a group of lung diseases that make it hard to breathe and can lead to chronic cough, dyspnea, and other respiratory symptoms.\n9. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): This is a complication of diabetes where the body produces keto bodies in response to high blood sugar levels, which can lead to metabolic acidosis and other complications.\n10. Pheochromocytoma: This is a type of cancer that occurs in the adrenal gland, typically releasing hormones such as epinephrine and norepinephrine, leading to sweating, hypertension, and other symptoms.",
