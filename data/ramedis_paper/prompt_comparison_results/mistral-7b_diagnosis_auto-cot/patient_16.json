    "predict_diagnosis": "   Kyphoscoliosis is a spinal deformity characterized by an abnormal curvature of the spine. There are various underlying causes of kyphoscoliosis, including congenital, neuromuscular, metabolic, infectious, and malignant factors. The top 10 most likely diagnoses of kyphoscoliosis, listed in order of probability, based on the patient's phenotype are:\n\n1. Congenital kyphoscoliosis - This is the most common type of kyphoscoliosis, which has an X-linked dominant inheritance pattern. It typically presents in infancy or childhood and involves significant curvature of the spine.\n2. Neuromuscular kyphoscoliosis - This type of kyphoscoliosis is associated with neuromuscular disorders, such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy, cerebral palsy, and spinal muscular atrophy. The spinal curvature in this type of kyphoscoliosis is often mild to moderate and is caused by abnormal muscle tone and strength.\n3. Metabolic kyphoscoliosis - This type of kyphoscoliosis is associated with metabolic disorders such as hyperparathyroidism, hypothyroidism, Marfan syndrome, and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. The spinal curvature in this type of kyphoscoliosis can be caused by bone abnormalities or hormonal imbalances.\n4. Infectious kyphoscoliosis - This type of kyphoscoliosis is associated with bacterial or viral infections that affect the spine or surrounding tissues. The spinal curvature in this type of kyphoscoliosis can be caused by bacteria such as Tuberculosis, Pseudomonas, and Staphylococcus aureus.\n5. Malignant kyphoscoliosis - This type of kyphoscoliosis is associated with malignancies such as osteosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, and Ewing's familial sarcoma. The spinal curvature in this type of kyphoscoliosis can be caused by the growth of cancer cells surrounding the spine.\n6. Idiopathic adolescent scoliosis (IAS) - this is a type of kyphoscoliosis that presents in adolescence, it is the most common type of scoliosis in adolescents, It is caused by postural imbalances or muscle imbalances.\n7. Osteogenesis imperfecta - This disorder is known as \"brittle bone disease\" and it can cause kyphoscoliosis due to abnormally weak connective tissues. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant or recessive pattern.\n8. Ehlers-Danlos syndrome - This disorder is characterized by abnormally flexible joints and skin, and it can cause kyphoscoliosis due to abnormally weak connective tissues. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant or recessive pattern.\n9. Marfan syndrome - This disorder is characterized by abnormally long and thin bones, skin, and muscles, and it can cause kyphoscoliosis. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern.\n10. Hodgkin's lymphoma - This type of cancer can cause kyphoscoliosis by affecting the spine and surrounding tissues. It is the least likely diagnosis but should be considered if other causes of kyphoscoliosis have been ruled out.",
