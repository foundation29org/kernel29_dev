    "predict_diagnosis": "   Based on the patient's phenotype, here are 10 possible diagnoses that could explain their symptoms:\n\n1. Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) - Jaundice, hepatosplenomegaly, abdominal distention, and fever are common symptoms of IBD, which can also cause delayed puberty, abnormal blood cell counts, abdominal pain, and abnormal pulmonary function.\n2. Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) - Delayed puberty, anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, pancytopenia, leukopenia, and abnormal liver function are all characteristic of MDS, which can also cause abnormal pulmonary function and abnormal cardiac function.\n3. Hemophilia - Hemophilia A or B can cause joint pain, bruising, and bleeding, as well as delayed puberty and abdominal distention. Hemophilia can also cause anemia, thrombocytopenia, and abnormal blood cell counts.\n4. Sickle Cell Anemia (SCA) - SCA can cause delayed puberty, abdominal pain, and anemia, as well as abnormal blood cell counts, jaundice, and bone pain. SCA can also cause abnormal liver function and abnormal pulmonary function.\n5. Diabetes Mellitus - Delayed puberty, abdominal distention, and anemia are all complications of diabetes mellitus. Hepatosplenomegaly, abnormal heart function, and abnormal blood cell counts can also be seen in diabetes.\n6. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) - SLE can cause delayed puberty, joint pain, fever, and anemia, as well as abnormal blood cell counts and abnormal liver function. SLE can also cause abnormal cardiac function and abnormal pulmonary function.\n7. Congenital Heart Disease (CHD) - CHD can cause delayed puberty, abnormal heart function, anemia, and abdominal distention, as well as abnormal blood cell counts and abnormal liver function. ChD can also cause abnormal pulmonary function and abnormal bone growth.\n8. Kwashiorkor - Kwashiorkor is a form of malnutrition that can cause delayed puberty, abdominal distention, anemia, and abnormal blood cell counts. Kwashiorkor can also cause abnormal liver function and abnormal cardiac function.\n9. Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) - FASD can cause delayed puberty, cognitive impairment, anemia, and abnormal blood cell counts, as well as abnormal liver function and abnormal cardiac function. FASD can also cause abnormal pulmonary function and abnormal bone growth.\n10. Sepsis - Sepsis can cause delayed puberty, jaundice, anemia, and abnormal blood cell counts, as well as abnormal liver function, abnormal cardiac function, and abnormal pulmonary function. Sepsis can also cause abdominal distention and bone pain. Sepsis can be a complication of other underlying conditions, such as IBD, MDS, or CHD.",
