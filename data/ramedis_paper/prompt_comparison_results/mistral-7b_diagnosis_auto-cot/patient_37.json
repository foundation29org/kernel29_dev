    "predict_diagnosis": "   Based on the patient's phenotype and findings, here are the top 10 most likely diagnoses:\n\n1. Alzheimer's disease: This is the most common cause of dementia and is known to present with cognitive impairment, memory loss, mood changes, and abnormal movements. Bilateral ptosis and difficulty walking may also be present.\n2. Frontotemporal dementia (FTD): This is another type of dementia that can affect cognitive abilities and movement. FTD has been linked to changes in cerebral white matter, and can cause difficulty walking and abnormal movements.\n3. Parkinson's disease (PD): PD is a movement disorder that can cause symptoms such as tremors, stiffness, and slowness of movement. Bilateral ptosis, difficulty walking, and EMG abnormalities are also common in PD.\n4. Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP): This is another type of FTD that can cause cognitive impairment, difficulty walking, and eye problems such as ptosis. PSP is also known to affect cerebral white matter and may cause EMG abnormalities.\n5. Multiple sclerosis (MS): This is an autoimmune disorder that can cause inflammation and damage to the central nervous system. MS can cause symptoms such as difficulty walking, cognitive impairment, and abnormal movements.\n6. Mitochondrial encephalomyopathy: This is a group of diseases that can affect the mitochondria, the powerhouses of the cell, and cause symptoms such as cognitive impairment, movement problems, and abnormal movements.\n7. Huntington's disease: This is a genetic disorder that can cause cognitive impairment, movement problems, and difficulty walking. Huntington's disease is known to affect cerebral white matter and may cause EMG abnormalities.\n8. Cerebral white matter disorders: Cerebral white matter disorders can cause symptoms such as difficulty walking, cognitive impairment, and abnormal movements. These disorders can be caused by various diseases such as multiple sclerosis, primary progressive ataxia, and demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy.\n9. Neuro-oncologic disorders: Brain tumors can cause symptoms such as difficulty walking, cognitive impairment, and abnormal movements. These tumors can include primary brain tumors such as gliomas and astrocytomas, as well as secondary brain tumors that have spread from elsewhere in the body.\n10. Autonomic dysfunctions: The patient's EMG findings and easy fatigability may suggest autonomic dysfunction, which can affect movement and cardiovascular function. This can be caused by various diseases such as diabetes, Parkinson's disease, and certain infections.",
