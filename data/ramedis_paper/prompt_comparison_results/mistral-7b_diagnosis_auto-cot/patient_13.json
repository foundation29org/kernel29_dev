    "predict_diagnosis": "   Abnormality of refraction and visual loss\nCafe-au-lait spots: can be associated with various diseases such as nephropharambotic osteonecrosis (NOPO), Marfan syndrome, and Fanconi anemia.\nCranial hyperostosis: associated with osteoclast-granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor-activating mutations (ORCA1/ORCA2 mutations) and inborn errors of metabolism.\nLarge cafe-au-lait macules with irregular margins: can be associated with growth hormone excess, skeletal dysplasias like polyostotic fibrous dysplasia, or congenital disorders of lysosomes such as Pompe disease.\nPolyostotic fibrous dysplasia: characterized by the proliferation of fibrous tissue in bones and can present as enlarged and deformed bones.\nAbnormal shape of the occiput: may be associated with craniosynostosis, a condition caused by premature fusion of cranial sutures.\nMelanoma: dark spots or moles with irregular borders can be indicative of melanoma, a type of skin cancer.\nNeurofibromas: fibrous tissue nodules that can develop in various areas of the body and can be associated with neurofibrominosis type 1 or type 2.\nPituitary hyperfunction: abnormality in refraction and visual loss can be a sign of hyperthyroidism or other pituitary hormone excesses.\nLysosomal storage disorders: can cause osteoclast activation and resulting bone pain or enlargement.\nOsteomyelitis: infection of bones and can present with bone pain, fever, and deformity.",
