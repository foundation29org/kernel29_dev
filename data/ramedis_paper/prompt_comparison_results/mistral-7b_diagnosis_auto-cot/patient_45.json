Cushing's syndrome due to adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) excess\n3. Hypertension (primary or secondary)\n4. Hyperkalemia (from excessive ESH production or use of potassium-sparing agents)\n5. Hypoalbuminemia (from reduced albumin synthesis or decreased levels of albumin-binding proteins)\n6. Hypercholesterolemia (from reduced clearance of LDL(low density lipoprotein) or increased production of cholesterol)\n7. Hyperuricosuria (from hypercholesterolemia or use of diuretics)\n8. Erythropoietin production by kidney tumor or other kidney disease\n9. Erythropoietin production by extrarenal mass such as liver or spleen tumor\n10. Diabetes mellitus causing hyperglycemia and proteinuria.\nIt is important to note that these are just the top 10 possible diagnoses and the actual diagnosis will depend on additional tests, imaging and evaluation.",
