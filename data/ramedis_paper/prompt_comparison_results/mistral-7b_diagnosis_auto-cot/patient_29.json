    "predict_diagnosis": "   The patient's phenotype suggests several different possible diagnoses, as there are a number of medical conditions that can present with similar symptoms. Here are the top 10 most likely diagnoses for the patient, listed in no particular order:\n\n1. Cardiomyopathy, familial restrictive: This is a rare genetic disorder that affects the heart muscle. It is characterized by a limited flexibility of the heart muscle, difficulty in filling with blood, and difficulty in delivering blood to the body's organs. Patients often present with symptoms such as heart failure, dyspnea, and pulmonary arterial hypertension.\n2. Cardiomyopathy, dilated: Dilated cardiomyopathy is one of the most common types of cardiomyopathy, and can be caused by a variety of factors including viral infections, drugs, and inflammation. Patients with dilated cardiomyopathy can present with symptoms such as heart failure, dyspnea, and palpitations.\n3. Cardiac hypertrophy: This is a condition where the heart muscle enlarges without necessarily becoming stiffer. It can be caused by factors such as hypertension, obesity, and drugs. Patients may present with symptoms such as dyspnea, palpitations, and chest pain.\n4. Cardiac amyloidosis: This is a rare disorder where the heart muscle is accumulated with abnormal protein substances, which can lead to heart failure. Patients may present with symptoms such as dyspnea, pulmonary arterial hypertension, and decreased ejection fraction.\n5. Heart valve disease: Diseases of the heart valves can lead to a variety of cardiac symptoms, including dyspnea, palpitations, chest pain, and heart failure. Mitral valve regurgitation, tricuspid valve regurgitation, aortic valve regurgitation, and pulmonary artery stenosis can all cause these symptoms.\n6. Diabetic cardiomyopathy: This is a condition characterized by heart failure and other cardiac symptoms resulting from diabetes. It can present with symptoms such as dyspnea, palpitations, chest pain, and heart failure.\n7. Endocarditis: This is a rare but serious condition in which bacteria or fungi infect the heart valves and surrounding tissues, leading to a variety of cardiac symptoms. It can present with symptoms such as dyspnea, chest pain, and heart failure.\n8. Cardiac tumors: Rare benign or malignant tumors can affect the heart and lead to cardiac symptoms. Possibilities include pericardial tumors, atrioventricular node tumors, and mitral annular calcification.\n9. Cardiac inflammation: Inflammation of the heart can cause a variety of cardiac symptoms, including dyspnea, chest pain, and heart failure. Some possible causes include sarcoidosis, giant cell arteritis, and lupus erythematosus.\n10. Pulmonary disease: Lung disorders can also cause cardiac symptoms such as dyspnea and heart failure. Possible pulmonary causes include emphysema, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and pulmonary hypertension.",
