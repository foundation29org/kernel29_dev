    "predict_diagnosis": "   1. Myasthenia Gris: A condition where the nerves leading to the muscles do not transmit impulses properly due to a defect of acetylcholine esterase, resulting in muscle weakness.\n2. Chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO): A subtype of ocular myasthenia gravis that presents with bilateral ptosis and difficulty moving the eyes.\n3. Atypical Parkinsonism: A condition characterized by stiffness, tremors, and difficulty with gait and balance, affecting the legs more than the arms, and often with difficulty climbing stairs.\n4. Congenital Adynamic Arthropathy (CAA): A rare genetic disorder characterized by joint hypermobility, muscle weakness, and bone pain.\n5. Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy: A X-linked progressive muscle disorder that presents with weakness, particularly in the legs, and difficulty walking.\n6. Mitochondrial Encephalomyopathy: A group of disorders that affect the mitochondria in the brain and nervous system, resulting in muscle weakness and neurological symptoms, including ptosis and dysarthria.\n7. Pompe Disease: A lysosomal storage disorder characterized by a deficiency of the enzyme glycogen phosphorylase, resulting in muscle weakness and the accumulation of glycogen in the muscles.\n8. Sjogren's Syndrome: An autoimmune disorder characterized by dryness in the mouth, eyes, and nose, as well as joint pain and muscle weakness.\n9. Sideroblastic Anemia: A group of anemias characterized by the presence of iron in the tissues that is not part of hemoglobin, resulting in muscle weakness and fatigue.\n10. Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS): An adult-onset motor neuron disease characterized by progressive weakness, difficulty with gait and balance, respiratory distress and death often within 2-5 years of diagnosis.",
