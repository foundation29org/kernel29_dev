    "predict_diagnosis": "   Sure! Based on the patient's symptoms and phenotype, the top 10 most likely diagnoses are:\n\n1. Myopathy with respiratory muscle weakness (e.g., Duchenne muscular dystrophy, inclusion body myopathy, sarcoidosis, polymyalgia rheumatica)\n2. Oculomotor apraxia syndrome\n3. Mast cell activation syndrome\n4. Multiple system atrophy (MSA)\n5. Dysphagia due to muscular weakness of the esophagus\n6. Dyspnea due to respiratory muscle weakness and/or dysautonomia\n7. Autonomic dysfunction or dysautonomia\n8. Diplopia and ptosis, bilateral or unilateral\n9. Myofasciitis or chronic fatigue syndrome\n10. Other possible myopathic or myofascial disorder with respiratory muscle weakness (e.g., mitochondrial disorders, glycogen storage disease, primary skeletal muscle myopathy, congenital myopathy, autoimmune myopathy)",
