    "predict_diagnosis": "   It's important to note that the provided phenotype is incomplete and that further diagnostic testing should be considered to reach a definitive diagnosis. However, based on the given symptoms, here are the top 10 most likely diagnoses:\n\n1. Diffuse myocarditis, which is a type of inflammation of the heart muscle. It is a rare but potentially serious condition, which can be caused by a variety of underlying factors, including infectious etiologies, autoimmune disorders, and other medical conditions.\n2. Endocarditis, which is an infection of the inner lining of the heart (the endocardium). It is a life-threatening condition that can occur in people with weakened immune systems, such as those with HIV/AIDS, cancer, or organ transplants.\n3. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which is a type of liver disease characterized by the accumulation of fat in liver cells. The liver can become inflamed, which can lead to liver damage, and it is a common cause of liver failure.\n4. Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, which is a type of heart failure in which the heart pumps adequately but the heart chambers are stiff, making it hard for the heart to fill and empty properly.\n5. Cardiac amyloidosis, which is a rare condition in which abnormal proteins accumulate in the heart muscles, causing heart failure.\n6. Hemochromatosis, which is a condition in which the body absorbs too much iron from food, leading to the accumulation of iron in the body, including the heart. Excess iron can damage heart muscle, leading to heart failure.\n7. Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS), which is a group of connective tissue genetic disorders characterized by a variety of connective tissue abnormalities, including joint hypermobility, skin hyperelasticity, and cardiovascular abnormalities. Cardiac EDS can cause left ventricular dilation and hypertrophy.\n8. Friedreich's ataxia, which is a rare genetic disorder that affects the nervous system and causes progressive loss of movement control and coordination, along with hearing loss and cardiomyopathy.\n9. Laminar endocarditis, which is a type of endocarditis that affects the inner lining of the heart, causing areas of calcium deposition and subsequent heart failure.\n10. Aortic aneurysm, which is a bulge in the aorta, the largest artery in the body, that can rupture and leak blood, leading to a life-threatening condition known as dissection. Aortic aneurysms are associated with hypertension and other cardiovascular risk factors.",
