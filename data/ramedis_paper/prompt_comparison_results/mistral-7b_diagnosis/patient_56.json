Hypercalcemia due to osteoporosis\n\nNote: Bartter syndrome, Gitelman syndrome, and Paget's disease are genetic disorders that cause renal potassium wasting, skin rash, and hyperchloriduria. Hypomagnesemia is another common feature of these disorders. Metabolic alkalosis can be caused by hypercalcemia, which is a condition that can lead to renal potassium wasting, dyspnea, and hypertension.",
