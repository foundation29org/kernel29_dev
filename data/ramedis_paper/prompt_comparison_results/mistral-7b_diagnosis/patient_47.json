    "predict_diagnosis": "   1. Goodpasture's disease: A rare autoimmune disorder that affects the kidneys and lungs, characterized by acute-on-chronic nephritis, sinusitis, and high-frequency sensorineural hearing impairment.\n2. Focal glomerulosclerosis: A type of nephritis that affects a limited number of glomeruli in the kidney. It may also cause sinusitis and high-frequency sensorineural hearing impairment.\n3. End-stage kidney disease (ESRD) secondary to primary disease: ESRD can cause nephritis, sinusitis, and other complications, including high-frequency sensorineural hearing impairment. Other primary diseases that can lead to ESRD include diabetes, lupus nephritis, amyloidosis, and vasculitis.\n4. Lupus nephritis: A complication of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) that affects the kidneys. It may cause nephritis, sinusitis, and high-frequency sensorineural hearing impairment.\n5. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS): A hormonal disorder that affects women of reproductive age, characterized by irregular menstruation, hirsutism, acne, and anovulation. It may also cause nephritis, sinusitis, and hearing impairment.\n6. Sjögren's syndrome: A chronic autoimmune disorder that affects the exocrine glands, characterized by dry eyes and mouth, fatigue, and joint pain. It may also cause nephritis and hearing impairment.\n7. Hemolytic uremic syndrome: A syndrome caused by the spread of abnormal bacteria from the intestines to kidneys, resulting in kidney damage, anemia, and jaundice. It may cause nephritis, sinusitis, and hearing impairment.\n8. Alport syndrome: An inherited disorder of collagen that affects the kidneys, causing progressive nephritis and hearing loss, particularly in high-frequency sensorineural hearing impairment.\n9. Interstitial lung disease (ILD): A group of lung disorders in which the interstitium, the tissue that separates the air sacs in the lungs, becomes inflamed and scarred. It may also cause nephritis and hearing impairment.\n10. Cushing's syndrome: A hormonal disorder caused by an overproduction of cortisol, a hormone that regulates stress and metabolism. It may cause nephritis, sinusitis, and hearing impairment.",
