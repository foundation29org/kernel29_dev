    "predict_diagnosis": "   1. Polyostotic Fibrous Dysplasia - A condition characterized by the abnormal growth of fibrous tissue in multiple bones (osteoclast activation). \r\n2. Monostotic Fibrous Dysplasia - A condition where abnormal bone growth occurs in a single bone (osteoclast activation). \r\n3. Precipitated Puberty - An early onset of sexual maturation in females, often caused by a hormonal imbalance or tumor. \r\n4. Thelarche - Enlargement of the breasts before age 9, often an indicator of ovarian function or tumor activity. \r\n5. Hypogonadism - A decreased function of the testes or ovaries, leading to infertility and secondary sexual characteristics delay. \r\n6. Tropical Dwarfism - A condition caused by a specific type of rickets in tropical regions, resulting in skeletal changes and delayed growth. \r\n7. Growth Hormone Excess - An excess in growth hormone, causing accelerated skeletal maturation and enlarged tonsils. \r\n8. Estrogen Receptor Beta (ER-B) Mutations - Mutations in the ER-B gene can lead to increased sensitivity to estrogen, resulting in ovarian cysts and enlarged uterus. \r\n9. Endometriosis - A condition where endometrial tissue is abnormally located in the pelvis, causing pain, abnormal vaginal bleeding, and enlarged uterus. \r\n10. Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone (GnRH) Antagonist Use - The use of GnRH antagonists in the treatment of ovarian cysts or uterine fibroids can cause ovarian cysts and accelerated ovarian function.",
