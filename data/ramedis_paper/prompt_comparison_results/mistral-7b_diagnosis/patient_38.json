    "predict_diagnosis": "   1. Myasthenia Gris: A rare neuro-muscular disorder characterized by weakness in multiple muscles, including the tongue, eyes, and limbs. Acetylcholine esterase inhibitors are favorably used in treatment.\n2. Niemann-Pick Disease Type C (NPC): A rare genetic disorder that affects lysosomal storage. It causes accumulation of cholesterol in brain cells, resulting in ischemic stroke, dementia, and ptosis.\n3. Polyalgia Rheumatica: A rare inflammatory disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of musculoskeletal pain and stiffness, usually involving small and medium joints, often accompanied by abnormal tendon reflexes.\n4. Hemiplegic Migraine: A rare type of migraine that causes temporary weakness and paralysis on one side of the body. Treatment involves preventive measures and pain relievers.\n5. Cerebrovascular Accident: Brain damage due to ischemia or hemorrhage can cause a range of symptoms, including weakness, slurred speech, and difficulty walking. Treatment depends on the type and severity of the injury.\n6. Alzheimer's Disease: A progressive dementia that affects memory, cognition, and behavior. It can cause cognitive impairment, difficulty with activities of daily living, and is associated with white matter degeneration.\n7. Dysthyretinemia: A rare genetic disorder characterized by hyperlipidemia, arterial calcification, and ischemic stroke. It's caused by mutations in the dysthyretin gene, which leads to an accumulation of abnormal protein in blood vessels.\n8. Cholesterol Storage Disease (CSD): A group of rare genetic disorders that affect cholesterol transport and storage in tissues, leading to accumulation of excess cholesterol in the brain, liver, or other organs. Common symptoms include ischemic stroke, ptosis, and easy fatigue.\n9. Hemifacial Spasm: A rare neurological disorder characterized by involuntary contractions or twitching of the muscles on one side of the face. It can be caused by a vascular compression of the facial nerve.\n10. Lyme Disease: A bacterial infection caused by Borrelia burgdorferi, transmitted by ticks. It can cause a range of symptoms, including myalgia, arthralgia, neuropsychiatric manifestations, and is associated with abnormal white matter signal intensity.",
