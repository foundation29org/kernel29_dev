The presented phenotype contains renal potassium wasting, hypokalemia, increased urinary potassium, hypocalciuria, and metabolic alkalosis. These findings can be associated with multiple rare diseases, which is why it is crucial to consider a broad differential diagnosis. Always consult with a healthcare professional before making any diagnostic decisions.",
