Further evaluation, including medical history, laboratory tests, and genetic testing, may be necessary to narrow down the diagnosis. It is important to consider other less likely conditions as well, as there are numerous rare and genetic disorders that could be potential causes. A comprehensive clinical assessment and appropriate diagnostic workup are crucial to arriving at the most accurate diagnosis.",
