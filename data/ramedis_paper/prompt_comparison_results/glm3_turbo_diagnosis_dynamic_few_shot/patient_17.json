Tricuspid valve prolapse\n6. Left ventricular hypertrophy\n7. Kyphoscoliosis\n8. Aortic root aneurysm\n9. Exercise-induced asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)\n10. Cardiac tamponade or pericardial effusion\n\nPlease note that this list is not exhaustive, and further evaluation and testing would be necessary to narrow down the diagnosis. The clinical presentation and phenotype of the patient could potentially overlap with other rare cardiovascular disorders, muscular dystrophies, or connective tissue diseases. It is crucial to consider these conditions as well when assessing the patient:\n\n1. Ehlers-Danlos syndrome\n2. Loeys-Dietz syndrome\n3. Turner syndrome\n4. hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy\n5. arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC)\n6. restrictive cardiomyopathy\n7. systemic sclerosis\n8. mixed connective tissue disease\n9. polymyositis/dermatomyositis\n10. muscular dystrophy (specifically, Becker muscular dystrophy and Duchenne muscular dystrophy)",
