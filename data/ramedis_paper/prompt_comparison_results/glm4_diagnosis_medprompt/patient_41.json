    "predict_diagnosis": "1. Multiple System Atrophy (MSA), particularly the cerebellar or parkinsonian subtype, given the combination of autonomic, cerebellar, and extrapyramidal symptoms.\n2. Spinocerebellar Ataxia (SCA), considering the cerebellar signs, ataxia, and possible dysarthria.\n3. Alzheimer's Disease with cerebellar involvement, given the cognitive impairment, memory loss, and cerebellar symptoms.\n4. Stroke, given the sudden onset of symptoms like visual loss, slurred speech, and cerebral ischemia.\n5. Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (NPH), considering the urinary incontinence, gait disturbances, and cognitive impairment.\n6. Autonomic Dysfunction Syndrome, given the urinary urgency/hesitancy/incontinence, xerostomia, and syncope.\n7. Mitochondrial Disease, considering the multi-system involvement, including neurologic, visual, and renal symptoms.\n8. Wilson's Disease, given the presence of Kayser-Fleischer rings (not explicitly mentioned but can be associated with abnormal fundus morphology), neurological symptoms, and renal hamartoma.\n9. Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), considering the arteriosclerosis, cognitive impairment, and abnormal cerebral white matter morphology.\n10. Frontotemporal Dementia with Parkinsonism-17 (FTDP-17), given the cognitive decline, decreased facial expression, and extrapyramidal symptoms.\n\nPlease note that these diagnoses are based on the symptoms provided and are not exhaustive. Additional clinical information, family history, and diagnostic test results would be necessary for a definitive diagnosis.",
