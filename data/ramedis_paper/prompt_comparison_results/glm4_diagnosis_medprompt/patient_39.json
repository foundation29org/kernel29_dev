Autoimmune Basal Ganglia Disease\n\nPlease note that the patient's clinical presentation includes a combination of neurologic, endocrine, and autoimmune features, which could indicate a complex interplay of diseases. The top 10 diagnoses listed above reflect a range of possibilities, considering the overlapping symptoms and the presence of thymus hyperplasia and thymoma, which are often associated with myasthenia gravis. However, a definitive diagnosis would require a thorough clinical evaluation, further laboratory testing, and possibly neuroimaging and other diagnostic studies.",
