Metabolic or genetic disorder with combined features of spastic paraplegia and hemangioma, such as MELAS (Mitochondrial Encephalopathy, Lactic Acidosis, and Stroke-like episodes)\n10. Ataxia telangiectasia with neurological involvement including spastic paraplegia and neuropathy\n\nPlease note that the presence of a hemangioma could be a coincidental finding or could be related to a systemic disorder, and the top 10 diagnoses attempt to cover a range of possibilities based on the symptoms provided. A precise diagnosis would require a thorough clinical evaluation, additional history, imaging studies, and possibly genetic testing.",
