Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder (NMOSD)\n5. Leukoencephalopathy with Myelopathy and Lactate Elevation (LEML)\n6. Autoimmune Autonomic Ganglionopathy\n7. Kennedy's Disease (Spinal Bulbar Muscular Atrophy)\n8. Mitochondrial Disease with Neurological Involvement\n9. Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL)\n10. Connective Tissue Disorder (e.g., Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, Sjögren's Syndrome) with Neurological Manifestations\n\nPlease note that the presence of anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies and the response to repetitive nerve stimulation on EMG suggest myasthenia gravis as a primary diagnosis. However, the additional clinical features broaden the differential and include other rare diseases that can present with overlapping symptoms.",
