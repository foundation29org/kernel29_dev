    "predict_diagnosis": "1. Alport syndrome, considering the proteinuria, glomerulonephritis, hearing impairment, and macroscopic hematuria.\n2. Dense deposit disease (type II membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis), given the proteinuria, glomerulonephritis, and abnormal urinary color.\n3. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), due to the presence of proteinuria, glomerulonephritis, hearing impairment, visual loss, fever, and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate.\n4. Mixed connective tissue disease, considering the overlapping symptoms of lupus, scleroderma, and polymyositis, which could present with the patient's phenotype.\n5. IgA nephropathy, given the recurrent tonsillitis, proteinuria, and macroscopic hematuria.\n6. Membranous nephropathy, as it can present with proteinuria, glomerulonephritis, and elevated cholesterol levels.\n7. Anti-glomerular basement membrane disease, which can cause glomerulonephritis, hematuria, and rapid progressive kidney failure.\n8. Fabry disease, as it can lead to proteinuria, glomerulonephritis, and systemic symptoms like fever, with possible cochleaN and retinal involvement causing hearing and visual loss.\n9. Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, considering the recurrent tonsillitis, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and potential renal involvement.\n10. Autoimmune polyangiitis, which can present with glomerulonephritis, hearing impairment, visual loss, and systemic symptoms like fever and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate.",
