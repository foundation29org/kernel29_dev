Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), given the presence of renal cysts and chronic kidney disease.\n3. Fabry disease, as it can present with glomerulonephritis, proteinuria, and hypercholesterolemia.\n4. Dense deposit disease (type II membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis), which can cause proteinuria, hematuria, and hypoalbuminemia.\n5. Hereditary nephritis with Uromodulin (UMOD) mutations, as it can lead to glomerulonephritis and chronic kidney disease.\n6. Loin pain hematuria syndrome, considering the renal cysts, hematuria, and poor appetite.\n7. Syndromic renal cyst and tubular dystrophy, which can present with various renal and extrarenal manifestations, including hearing impairment.\n8. Hyper IgM syndrome, given the leukocytosis and thrombocytosis, which can be associated with renal abnormalities.\n9. Tubulointerstitial nephritis with uveitis (TINU) syndrome, as it can cause hearing impairment and renal involvement.\n10. Prostate cancer with metastatic involvement of the kidneys, given the abnormal prostate morphology and renal cysts.",
