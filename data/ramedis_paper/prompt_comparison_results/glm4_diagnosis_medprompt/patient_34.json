    "predict_diagnosis": "1. Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) – due to the presence of upper and lower limb muscle weakness, abnormal corticospinal tract morphology, and poor fine motor coordination.\n2. Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) – considering the abnormal joint and finger morphology, interosseus muscle atrophy, and neuropathic changes on EMG.\n3. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) – because of the muscle weakness, difficulty walking, and neuropathic changes on EMG, although the absence of mention of bulbar symptoms makes this less likely.\n4. Primary lateral sclerosis (PLS) – characterized by upper motor neuron symptoms such as spasticity and difficulty walking, without significant muscle atrophy.\n5. Myopathy with myotonia – exercise-induced leg cramps and hand muscle weakness could be indicative of myotonic disorders.\n6. Mitochondrial myopathy – given the diverse clinical presentation including weakness, exercise intolerance, and morphological abnormalities.\n7. Polymyositis – with features of muscle weakness, abnormal muscle tone, and EMG changes, although the mention of atrophy makes this less likely without skin rash.\n8. Kennedy disease (SBMA) – a rare form of motor neuron disease with progressive muscle weakness and atrophy, can present with cramps and poor coordination.\n9. Friedrich's ataxia – can present with difficulty walking, limb weakness, and poor coordination, although the absence of ataxia symptoms makes this less likely.\n10. Myasthenia gravis (MG) – considering the upper limb muscle weakness and fatigable weakness, although the absence of ptosis and response to acetylcholine esterase inhibitors makes this less likely.",
