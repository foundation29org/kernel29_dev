Dense deposit disease (type II membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis)\n9. C3 glomerulopathy\n10. Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome) with renal involvement\n\nEach of these conditions can present with a combination of nephritis, hearing impairment, hematuria, and sinusitis, and some may also cause abnormal urinary color. It is important to note that a thorough clinical evaluation, including family history, genetic testing, and additional laboratory and imaging studies, would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.",
