Autoimmune polyangiitis, given the presence of xerostomia, chronic diarrhea, arthralgia, and increased blood urea nitrogen.\n3. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), due to the combination of proteinuria, hematuria, thrombocytosis, leukocytosis, and arthralgia.\n4. Sjögren's syndrome, as xerostomia and chronic diarrhea are key symptoms, potentially overlapping with other connective tissue diseases.\n5. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) with renal involvement, considering the chronic diarrhea and elevated blood urea nitrogen.\n6. Congenital nephrotic syndrome, given the proteinuria, hematuria, and possibility of premature birth.\n7. Dense deposit disease (type II membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis), which can present with proteinuria, hematuria, and thrombocytosis.\n8. Malignancy-related paraneoplastic syndrome, as drowsiness and leukocytosis can be associated with certain cancers.\n9. Cystic fibrosis-related diabetes, given the chronic diarrhea, xerostomia, and decreased body weight.\n10. Vascular-type Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, considering the potential for renal involvement, arthralgia, and hypertension.",
