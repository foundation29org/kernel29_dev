Primary lateral sclerosis, particularly if the clinical presentation is predominantly upper motor neuron signs.\n3. Hereditary spastic paraplegias, considering the spastic gait and hyperactive deep tendon reflexes.\n4. Multi-system atrophy, parkinsonian variant, given the presence of dysarthria and sleep disturbances.\n5. Progressive supranuclear palsy, which can present with gait difficulty, pseudobulbar palsy, and upper limb weakness.\n6. Spinocerebellar ataxia with pyramidal features, given the hypertonia and gait abnormalities.\n7. Wilson's disease, if there are associated neurological symptoms such as tremor, dystonia, or ataxia.\n8. Metabolic or mitochondrial disorder leading to a neuromuscular presentation, considering the diverse symptoms.\n9. Cerebral ischemia or stroke, particularly if the coma and sudden onset of symptoms suggest a vascular event.\n10. Neurosyphilis, considering the array of neurological symptoms and the potential for tabes dorsalis presenting with a spastic gait and upper motor neuron signs.",
