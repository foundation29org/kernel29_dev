Multiple system atrophy (MSA), specifically parkinsonian variant with autonomic failure\n3. Autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxias (ADCA) with associated extrapyramidal symptoms\n4. Neurodegenerative disease with polyglutamine expansion (e.g., Huntington's disease with atypical presentation)\n5. Mitochondrial disease, particularly with cerebellar and extrapyramidal involvement\n6. Wilson's disease, presenting with hepatic steatosis, neurological symptoms, and urinary issues\n7. Metabolic myopathy with associated neuropathy, potentially due to a fatty acid oxidation disorder\n8. Paraneoplastic syndrome, given abnormal urine cytology and associated neurological findings\n9. Atypical Parkinson's disease with coexisting cerebellar signs and autonomic dysfunction\n10. Fahr's disease (idiopathic basal ganglia calcification) with a wide range of neurologic symptoms including movement disorders and cognitive decline. \n\nEach of these conditions could potentially present with a combination of the symptoms described, and the list is not exhaustive. A precise diagnosis would require a detailed clinical examination, further laboratory testing, neuroimaging studies, and possibly genetic testing.",
