    "predict_diagnosis": "   Based on the patient's phenotype, here are the top 10 most likely diagnoses:\n\n1. Cardiomyopathy, familial restrictive, 1: This is a rare, genetic heart condition that affects ventricular fibrillation and exercise intolerance.\n2. Myocardial ischemia: This condition occurs when the blood flow to the heart is decreased, resulting in chest pain and ST segment elevation on an ECG.\n3. Pneumonia: This is an infection that affects the lungs and causes dyspnea, cough, and pneumonia.\n4. Viral hepatitis: This is a viral infection that affects the liver and causes viral hepatitis.\n5. Cardiac arrhythmias: These are abnormal heart rhythms that can cause ventricular fibrillation, leading to cardiac arrest.\n6. Pulmonary hypertension: This is a condition in which the blood vessels in the lungs become narrowed or constricted, causing high blood pressure in the lungs.\n7. Sepsis: This is a potentially life-threatening condition that occurs when the body's response to infection causes harm to itself.\n8. Kidney disease: This can cause electrolyte imbalances, leading to dyspnea and arrhythmias.\n9. Obstructive sleep apnea: This condition is caused by a blockage in the airway during sleep and can cause shortness of breath, leading to exercise intolerance.\n10. Hypothermia: This is a potentially dangerous condition that occurs when the body's core temperature drops below a certain level, leading to arrhythmias, confusion, and hypotension.",
