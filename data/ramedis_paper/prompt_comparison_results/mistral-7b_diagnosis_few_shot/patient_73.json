    "predict_diagnosis": "   Here is a potential set of 10 possible differential diagnoses for the patient:\n\n1. Down Syndrome: A common genetic condition characterized by intellectual disability, facial features, and certain medical issues such as tetany, congenital heart disease, and hearing loss.\n2. Angelman Syndrome: A rare genetic disorder that affects the brain and causes features such as intellectual disability, facial features, and hyperactivity, among other things.\n3. Marfan Syndrome: A connective tissue disorder that affects the body's tissues and organs, causing features such as elongated limbs, joint dislocation, and cardiovascular problems.\n4. Severe Cerebral Palsy: A motor disorder characterized by weakness, stiffness, and abnormal movements, affecting one or both sides of the body.\n5. Wilson's Disease: A rare genetic disorder caused by copper buildup in the brain and the liver, leading to neurological issues such as tremors, tics, and dementia.\n6. Sanfilippo Syndrome: A rare genetic disorder characterized by autism-like symptoms, seizures, and hyperactivity, among other things.\n7. Rett Syndrome: A rare genetic disorder affecting mainly females and characterized by developmental regression, seizures, and difficulties with walking, speech, and breathing.\n8. Mucopolysaccharidosis: A group of genetic disorders that affect the way the body processes mucopolysaccharides, leading to features such as joint stiffness, enlargement of the spleen, and hearing loss.\n9. Cystic Fibrosis: A genetic disorder that affects the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and reproductive systems, causing features such as chronic lung infections, difficulty digesting foods, and infertility.\n10. Krabbe Disease: A rare genetic disorder that affects the central nervous system, leading to progressive neurological decline, vision problems, and in severe cases, loss of consciousness.",
