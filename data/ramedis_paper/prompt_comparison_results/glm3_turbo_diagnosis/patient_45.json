Medullary sponge kidney (MSK)\n\nPlease note that this list is not exhaustive, and further evaluation and testing will be necessary to narrow down the diagnosis. The clinical presentation is suggestive of renal disease, and it is essential to consider various etiologies, including genetic, inflammatory, and metabolic disorders. The presence of hypertension, proteinuria, and hematuria raises the suspicion of glomerular disease, which is reflected in the list above. However, a comprehensive workup, including renal biopsy, laboratory tests, and genetic testing, will be crucial to establish the definitive diagnosis.",
