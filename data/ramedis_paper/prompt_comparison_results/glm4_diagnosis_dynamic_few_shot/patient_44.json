    "predict_diagnosis": "1. Multiple System Atrophy (MSA), particularly the parkinsonian or cerebellar type, given the combination of autonomic symptoms, cerebellar signs, and parkinsonian features.\n2. Parkinson's Disease with autonomic dysfunction, considering the bradykinesia, gait instability, and urinary symptoms.\n3. Autonomic Dysfunction Syndrome, given the presence of urinary incontinence, nocturia, and bowel incontinence.\n4. Diabetes Mellitus with neuropathy, given the patient's history of diabetes and symptoms like paresthesia, impaired vibration and pain sensation.\n5. Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) exacerbating urinary symptoms, considering the positive Romberg sign and urinary hesitancy.\n6. Spinal Cord Compression or Myelopathy, given the abnormal intervertebral disk morphology and signs like hyporeflexia and Babinski sign.\n7. Peripheral Neuropathy, given the paresthesia, impaired sensation, and fibroma which could be related to neuropathic changes.\n8. Hypogonadism-related neuroendocrine disorder, considering male hypogonadism and its potential impact on overall health and cognition.\n9. Cerebral Small Vessel Disease, given memory impairment, slurred speech, and the possibility of associated white matter changes.\n10. Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP), given the broad-based gait, falls, and cognitive changes, though this would be less likely with the urinary incontinence and autonomic features.",
