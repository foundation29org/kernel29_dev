Infiltrative cardiomyopathies (e.g., Anderson-Fabry disease, transthyretin amyloidosis)\n5. Systemic sclerosis with myocardial fibrosis and renal crisis\n6. Mixed connective tissue disease with cardiomyopathy and interstitial lung disease\n7. Primary hyperoxaluria with nephrolithiasis and systemic manifestations including cardiomyopathy\n8. Mitochondrial myopathy with multi-organ involvement, including cardiomyopathy and liver disease\n9. Right ventricular cardiomyopathy with arrhythmia and systemic thrombosis\n10. Chagas disease with chronic myocarditis, cardiomyopathy, and hepatobiliary involvement\n\nPlease note that the list above is speculative and based on the symptoms provided. A definitive diagnosis would require a thorough clinical evaluation, including detailed medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests, imaging studies, and potentially genetic testing.",
