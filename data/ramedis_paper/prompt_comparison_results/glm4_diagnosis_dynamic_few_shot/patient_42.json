    "predict_diagnosis": "1. Multiple System Atrophy (MSA), particularly the parkinsonian or cerebellar type, given the urinary incontinence, bradykinesia, broad-based gait, and cerebellar signs like dysdiadochokinesis.\n2. Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP), considering the hallucinations, syncope, bradykinesia, falls, and abnormal eye movements which could present as dilated fourth ventricle on imaging.\n3. Alzheimer's Disease with parkinsonism, given the hallucinations, sleep disturbance, and cognitive impairment suggested by dyscalculia, which could also present with some of the motor symptoms.\n4. Corticobasal Degeneration (CBD), given the hyperactivity, hyperkinetic movements, and the Babinski sign, which could be associated with the cortical dysfunction seen in CBD.\n5. Frontotemporal Dementia with Parkinsonism-17 (FTDP-17), considering the combination of hallucinations, bradykinesia, and frontotemporal lobe atrophy suggested by the dilated fourth ventricle.\n6. Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (NPH), given the symptoms of urinary incontinence, gait disturbance, and cognitive impairment, which could be associated with the dilated fourth ventricle.\n7. Wilson's Disease, given the hepatic steatosis and hyperkinetic movements, which could be indicative of the neurological and hepatic manifestations of the disease.\n8. Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia (HSP), considering the lower limb hypertonia, muscle weakness, and spinal canal stenosis, which are common features of HSP.\n9. Mitochondrial Disease, given the diverse symptoms including urinary incontinence, hepatic steatosis, and neurological manifestations, which can be seen in mitochondrial encephalomyopathy.\n10. Cerebellar Degeneration, given the dysdiadochokinesis, broad-based gait, and cerebellar atrophy suggested by pontocerebellar atrophy, which could present with the described symptoms.",
