    "predict_diagnosis": "1. Multiple System Atrophy (MSA), particularly the cerebellar or parkinsonian subtype, given the combination of autonomic symptoms, cerebellar signs, and extrapyramidal symptoms.\n2. Spinocerebellar Ataxia type 2 (SCA2), considering the cerebellar ataxia, dysarthria, andRomberg sign, along with the possible presence of a hemangioma.\n3. Alzheimer's disease with cerebellar involvement, given the memory impairment, EEG abnormality, and cerebellar signs such as clumsiness and waddling gait.\n4.Stroke or cerebrovascular disease, given the presence of visual loss, cerebral ischemia, and abnormal cerebral white matter morphology.\n5. Autonomic Dysfunction Syndrome, given the urinary and bowel incontinence, xerostomia, and orthostatic hypotension (syncope).\n6. Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (NPH), considering the gait abnormalities, urinary incontinence, and cognitive impairment.\n7. Mitochondrial Disease, given the multi-system involvement, including the central nervous system, and the presence of a renal hamartoma.\n8. Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT), given the hemangioma and patent foramen ovale, which can present with cerebrovascular symptoms.\n9. Ataxia-Telangiectasia, considering the cerebellar ataxia, increased body weight, and possible immune dysfunction.\n10. Fahr's Disease or other causes of basal ganglia calcification, given the presence of dyskinesia, poor fine motor coordination, and EEG abnormality. \n\nPlease note that this list is speculative and based on the symptoms provided. A definitive diagnosis would require a thorough clinical evaluation, including detailed medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests, and possibly neuroimaging studies.",
