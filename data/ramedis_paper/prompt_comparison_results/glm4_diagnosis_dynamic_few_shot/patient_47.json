Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with renal and otic involvement\n4. Wegener's granulomatosis with renal and upper respiratory tract involvement\n5. Microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) with glomerulonephritis and sinusitis\n6. Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA), previously Churg-Strauss syndrome\n7. Anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) disease\n8. IgA nephropathy with concurrent sinusitis and hearing loss\n9. Hereditary nephritis with otitis media and sinusitis\n10. Primary membranous nephropathy with concurrent hearing impairment and sinusitis\n\nEach of these conditions could potentially present with a combination of nephritis, hearing impairment, sinusitis, and the urinary symptoms described in the patient's phenotype. It is important to note that a thorough clinical evaluation, including laboratory tests, imaging studies, and potentially genetic testing, would be necessary to confirm any of these diagnoses.",
