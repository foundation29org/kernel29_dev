Mitochondrial myopathy with polygenic inheritance, manifesting with neuromuscular symptoms and cardiomyopathy\n4. Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) with autonomic dysfunction and associated prostatitis\n5. Autoimmune autonomic neuropathy with urological and neurological symptoms\n6. Multisystem atrophy (MSA), specifically parkinsonian variant with urological and cardiovascular manifestations\n7. Amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy and renal involvement leading to urinary symptoms\n8. Endocrine disorders such as adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease) with electrolyte imbalance and associated cardiac symptoms\n9. Channelopathy, such as Long QT syndrome or a rarer variant with ST segment elevation and syncope\n10. Metabolic myopathy, such as glycogen storage disease with exercise intolerance and myopathy\n\nEach of these conditions could potentially present with a combination of the symptoms described, and the list is not exhaustive. Further clinical evaluation, targeted laboratory testing, genetic testing, and possibly specialist consultations would be necessary to refine the diagnosis.",
