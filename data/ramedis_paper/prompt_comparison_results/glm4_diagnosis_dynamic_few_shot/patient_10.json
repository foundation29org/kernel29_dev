    "predict_diagnosis": "1. McCune-Albright syndrome (MAS)\n2. Polyostotic fibrous dysplasia with precocious puberty\n3. Osteogenesis imperfecta type VI or VII with skin and vaginal abnormalities\n4. Alkaptonuria with early-onset arthritis and oculocutaneous manifestations\n5. Melanotic Xanthogranuloma with bone involvement and endocrine disturbances\n6. Leprechaunism (Donohue syndrome) with bone dysplasia and endocrine dysfunction\n7. Rett syndrome with gait abnormalities and skeletal issues\n8. Mitochondrial disease with hearing impairment and myopathy\n9. Tuberous Sclerosis Complex with adenoid hypertrophy and bone lesions\n10. Hyperophic Osteoarthropathy with fibrous dysplasia and endocrine irregularities\n\nPlease note that these are differential diagnoses based on the symptoms provided, and further clinical, genetic, and imaging studies would be necessary to confirm the correct diagnosis. McCune-Albright syndrome appears as a likely diagnosis given the cafe-au-lait spots, fibrous dysplasia, and endocrine disturbances, but the presence of additional symptoms suggests a broader differential should be considered.",
