Chronic kidney disease (CKD) secondary to primary sclerosing cholangitis with hypercholesterolemia and hyperuricosuria. \n\nEach of these diagnoses could potentially present with a combination of the symptoms and signs described in the patient's phenotype, and further clinical, laboratory, and genetic testing would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.",
