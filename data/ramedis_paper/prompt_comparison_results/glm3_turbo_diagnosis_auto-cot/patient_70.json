    "predict_diagnosis": "1. **Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH)**: This is characterized by a hyperactive immune system, leading to hepatosplenomegaly, fever, and recurrent infections.\n\n2. **Lysosomal storage diseases (e.g., Pompe disease)**: These can cause hepatosplenomegaly, abdominal distention, and skeletal involvement.\n\n3. **Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF)**: FMF presents with recurrent fevers, abdominal pain, and joint inflammation.\n\n4. **Cystic fibrosis (CF)**:CF can lead to recurrent respiratory infections, pancreatic insufficiency, and hepatosplenomegaly.\n\n5. **Wilms tumor (nephroblastoma)**: This is a pediatric cancer that can present with abdominal swelling and urinary incontinence.\n\n6. **Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID)**: SCID can cause recurrent infections, failure to thrive, and hepatosplenomegaly.\n\n7. **Gaucher disease**: This is a lysosomal storage disease that can present with hepatosplenomegaly, bone-marrow involvement, and bruising.\n\n8. **Niemann-Pick disease**: Another lysosomal storage disease, it can cause hepatosplenomegaly, bone-marrow foam cells, and developmental regression.\n\n9. **Mucopolysaccharidosis (e.g., Hunter syndrome)**: These are characterized by progressive organ damage, skeletal abnormalities, and hepatosplenomegaly.\n\n10. **Fabry disease**: This X-linked disorder causes deposition of lipids in various tissues, leading to systemic symptoms and organ involvement.",
