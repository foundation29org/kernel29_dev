    "predict_diagnosis": "1. **Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome**: A group of genetic disorders affecting the connective tissue, potentially leading to hyperelasticity and fragility of the skin, joints, and blood vessels.\n\n2. **Osteogenesis Imperfecta**: Also known as brittle bone disease, it is a group of genetic disorders that affect the development of bones, leading to fragile and easily broken bones.\n\n3. **Marfan Syndrome**: A genetic disorder that affects the body's connective tissue, causing the body's features to be elongated and fragile.\n\n4. **Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA)**: A genetic disorder characterized by the loss of motor neurons in the spinal cord, leading to muscle wasting and weakness.\n\n5. **Dystrophin-Deficient MD**: Dystrophin is a protein that helps maintain the integrity of muscle cells. Mutations in the dystrophin gene can lead to muscle damage and weakness.\n\n6. **Myotonic Dystrophy**: The most common form of adult muscular dystrophy, characterized by an inability to relax muscles following contractions, leading to progressive muscle wasting and weakness.\n\n7. **Fibromyalgia**: A chronic pain disorder characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, and tenderness in localized areas.\n\n8. **Ankylosing Spondylitis**: A type of arthritis that causes inflammation of the spine and large joints, potentially leading to fusion of the vertebrae and restrictive deformities.\n\n9. **Scheuermann's Kyphosis**: A condition in which the vertebrae of the spine become wedge-shaped and cause a forward curvature of the spine, known as kyphosis.\n\n10. **Postural Kyphosis**: A type of kyphosis that results from poor posture, often due to weakness or poor muscle tone, rather than from structural deformity in the spine.",
