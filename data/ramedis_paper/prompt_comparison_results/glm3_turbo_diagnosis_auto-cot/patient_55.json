    "predict_diagnosis": "1. **Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD)**: Characterized by renal cysts, hypertension, and progressive kidney failure.\n\n2. **Membranous Glomerulonephritis**: Causes proteinuria, hematuria, and hypertension, potentially leading to renal failure.\n\n3. **IgA Nephropathy**: Present with hematuria, proteinuria, and can lead to glomerulonephritis.\n\n4. **Fabry Disease**: An X-linked inherited disorder leading to globotriaosylceramide accumulation, which can affect the kidneys and heart.\n\n5. **Marfan Syndrome**: A connective tissue disorder associated with cardiovascular manifestations, such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and skeletal abnormalities.\n\n6. **Loeys-Dietz Syndrome**: Aortic aneurysms,orticocavitary septal defects, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy are characteristic features.\n\n7. **Takayasu's Arteritis**: An inflammatory disease affecting large vessels, potentially leading to renal involvement and hypertension.\n\n8. **Ankylosing Spondylitis**: An inflammatory disease of the spine that can lead to systemic involvement and secondary glomerulonephritis.\n\n9. **Rheumatoid Arthritis**: Can cause glomerulonephritis and systemic vasculitis, leading to renal involvement.\n\n10. **Hypertriglyceridemia-Induced Pancreatitis**: Can cause pancreatitis, leading to secondary renal failure due to systemic inflammation and dehydration.\n\nIt is important to note that these diagnoses should be considered in the context of the patient's entire clinical picture, including family history, genetic testing results, and response to treatment. A thorough evaluation by a multidisciplinary team is essential for accurate diagnosis and management.",
