    "predict_diagnosis": "1. **Loeys-Dietz syndrome**: A connective tissue disorder that can present with arterial aneurysms,orticadefects, and skeletal features such as fractured hand bones.\n\n2. **Marfan syndrome**: A genetic disorder affecting the body's connective tissue, often presenting with long limbs, aortic aneurysms, and skeletal abnormalities.\n\n3. **Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP)**: A rare genetic condition where muscle tissue turns into bone, leading to progressive restriction of joint movement.\n\n4. **Osteogenesis imperfecta (Brittle bone disease)**: Causes fragile bones that break easily, which can be associated with hearing loss and blue sclerae.\n\n5. **Ehlers-Danlos syndrome**: A group of genetic disorders that affect the body's connective tissue, leading to hyperelasticity and fragility of the skin, joints, and blood vessels.\n\n6. **Alport syndrome**: A genetic disorder affecting the kidneys and ears, leading to progressive renal failure and sensorineural hearing loss.\n\n7. **Polycystic kidney disease**: Causes multiple cysts in the kidneys, which can lead to proteinuria and kidney failure.\n\n8. **Blau syndrome**: An autoimmune disorder characterized by inflammation of the joints, eyes, and skin, potentially leading to hearing loss and renal involvement.\n\n9. **Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD)**: An inherited disorder of the immune system, which can lead to recurring infections and granulomas in various organs, potentially affecting the ears.\n\n10. **Noonan syndrome**: A genetic disorder that can cause a wide range of symptoms, including heart defects, skeletal anomalies, and developmental delays, sometimes associated with hearing loss.",
