    "predict_diagnosis": "1. **Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)**: A progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects motor neurons, leading to muscle weakness and atrophy, spasticity, and difficulty swallowing and speaking.\n\n2. **Multiple Sclerosis (MS)**: An autoimmune disease that can cause inflammation and damage to the myelin sheath, leading to a wide range of neurological symptoms, including weakness, spasticity, and difficulty walking.\n\n3. **Motor Neuron Disease (MND)**: A group of progressive neurological disorders that destroy motor neurons. This includes ALS, but also other less common forms like primary lateral sclerosis.\n\n4. **Huntington's Disease**: An autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder characterized by uncoordinated movements, cognitive decline, and psychiatric symptoms.\n\n5. **Myotonic Dystrophy**: The most common form of adult muscular dystrophy, characterized by an inability to relax muscles following contractions (myotonia), progressive muscle wasting, and weakness.\n\n6. **Metabolic Myopathies**: A group of disorders that affect the chemical processes involved in muscle metabolism, leading to muscle weakness, exercise intolerance, and sometimes myoglobinuria.\n\n7. **Peripheral Neuropathy**: Damage to the peripheral nerves can lead to muscle weakness, numbness, and tingling, often affecting the hands and feet.\n\n8. **Spinal Cord Injury (SCI)**: A trauma that results in damage to the spinal cord can lead to paralysis and a variety of neurological symptoms, depending on the location and severity of the injury.\n\n9. **Stroke**: A blockage or rupture of a blood vessel in the brain can lead to neurological deficits, including weakness, difficulty speaking, and difficulty walking.\n\n10. **Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB)**: A type of progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects cognition, motor skills, and behavior, often with visual hallucinations and parkinsonism.\n\nThese diagnoses should be considered in the context of the patient's medical history, family history, and results of physical and neurological examinations, as well as laboratory and imaging studies. It is important to note that only a qualified healthcare professional can make an accurate diagnosis.",
