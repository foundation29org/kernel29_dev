Cardiomyopathy, hypertrophic\n8. Cardiomyopathy, dilated\n9. Restrictive cardiomyopathy\n10. Right heart failure\n\nThese diagnoses are considered because they can present with a combination of cardiovascular, pulmonary, and systemic features. Marfan syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome are connective tissue disorders that can affect the cardiovascular system, leading to aortic aneurysms and valvular abnormalities. Loeys-Dietz syndrome is also a connective tissue disorder with similar features. Bicuspid aortic valve is a common valve abnormality that can lead to aortic regurgitation and hypertension. Aortic coarctation is a narrowing of the aorta that can cause hypertension and other symptoms. Pulmonary hypertension can lead to right heart failure and systemic symptoms. Cardiomyopathies, whether hypertrophic, dilated, or restrictive, can present with cardiomegaly, valve abnormalities, and heart failure. Finally, right heart failure can lead to systemic venous congestion and symptoms such as dyspnea and ascites.",
