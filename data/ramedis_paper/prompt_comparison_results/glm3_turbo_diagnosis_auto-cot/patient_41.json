    "predict_diagnosis": "1. **Multiple System Atrophy (MSA)**: This is a rare neurodegenerative disorder that can present with autonomic dysfunction (urinary urgency, incontinence), motor symptoms (dysarthria, syncope, slurred speech), and cerebellar signs (dysdiadochokinesis, clumsiness, poor fine motor coordination).\n\n2. **Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD)**: Characterized by kidney cysts, hypertension, and sometimes urinary symptoms. It can also present with hepangiomas and renal hamartoma.\n\n3. **Neurogenic Bladder**: Caused by neurological disorders, it can lead to urinary urgency, hesitancy, and incontinence. It can be associated with autonomic neuropathy and EEG abnormalities.\n\n4. **Moyamoya Disease**: A rare cerebrovascular disorder leading to stenosis of cerebral arteries, which can cause cerebral ischemia, syncope, and memory impairment.\n\n5. **Metabolic Syndrome**: A cluster of conditions that increase the risk of heart disease, stroke, and diabetes, which can present with hypertension, obesity, and insulin resistance.\n\n6. **Hemiplegia/Hemiparesis**: Paralysis or weakness of one side of the body, which can lead to urinary incontinence and various gait abnormalities.\n\n7. **Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration (FTLD)**: A group of disorders leading to progressive degeneration of the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain, presenting with changes in behavior, personality, and language, along with motor symptoms.\n\n8. **Cortical Basal Degeneration (CBD)**: A rare neurodegenerative disorder characterized by atrophy of the basal ganglia and cerebral cortex, which can present with a combination of parkinsonism, dystonia, and cognitive decline.\n\n9. **Peripheral Neuropathy**: A group of disorders affecting the peripheral nerves, which can lead to urinary urgency, sensory changes, and motor weakness.\n\n10. **Myotonic Dystrophy**: An inherited muscle disease presenting with muscle weakness, wasting, and myotonia, which can also affect the heart and kidneys.\n\nThese diagnoses are complex and can overlap in their clinical presentation. It is important to note that a comprehensive clinical evaluation, including detailed family history, specialized testing (such as brain MRI, EMG, EEG), and laboratory investigations, would be necessary to confirm any diagnosis.",
