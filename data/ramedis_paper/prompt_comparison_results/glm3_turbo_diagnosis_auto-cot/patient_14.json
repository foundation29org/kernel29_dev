    "predict_diagnosis": "1. **Premature Thelarche**: Early development of secondary sexual characteristics before the age of 8 in girls, which can be idiopathic or associated with syndromes like Noonan syndrome or McCune-Albright syndrome.\n\n2. **Congenital Hypothyroidism**: Persistent hypothyroidism from birth, which can lead to developmental delays and cafe-au-lait spots if not treated promptly.\n\n3. **Luteal Phase defect**: A condition where the corpus luteum does not function properly, leading to menstrual irregularities and potentially affecting estradiol and progesterone levels.\n\n4. **Gonadotropin-secreting Tumor**: A tumor that secretes gonadotropins, leading to early puberty and hormonal imbalances.\n\n5. **Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)**: An endocrine disorder characterized by ovarian cysts and hormonal imbalances, which can present with menstrual irregularities, elevated androgens, and insulin resistance.\n\n6. **McCune-Albright Syndrome**: A rare骨肉瘤病 that causes precocious puberty, cafe-au-lait spots, and fibrous dysplasia of the bones.\n\n7. **Noonan Syndrome**: A genetic disorder characterized by short stature, webbed neck, wide-set eyes, and developmental delays, often associated with congenital hypothyroidism.\n\n8. **Turner Syndrome**: A genetic condition that affects females, typically leading to short stature, lack of sexual development, and often associated with thyroid dysfunction.\n\n9. **21-Hydroxylase Deficiency**: A rare endocrine disorder that can lead to salt-wasting adrenal crisis, ambiguous genitalia, and developmental delays.\n\n10. **Female Pseudohermaphroditism**: A condition where there is a discrepancy between internal and external genitalia, which can be due to various endocrine disorders or genetic conditions.\n\nIt is important to note that this list is not exhaustive, and the actual diagnosis would require a thorough clinical evaluation, including a detailed medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests, and possibly genetic testing.",
