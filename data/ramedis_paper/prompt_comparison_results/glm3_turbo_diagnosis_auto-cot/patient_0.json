    "predict_diagnosis": "1. **Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS)**: Characterized by hypotonia, growth retardation, delayed speech and language development, and hyperphagia.\n\n2. **Down Syndrome (DS)**: Can present with hypotonia, delayed development, and speech difficulties.\n\n3. **Trisomy 18 (Edwards Syndrome)**: Often associated with hypotonia, developmental delays, and growth retardation.\n\n4. **Trisomy 21 (Down Syndrome)**: As mentioned before, this condition can present with similar symptoms to those described.\n\n5. **Congenital Hypotonia**: A neuromuscular disorder characterized by low muscle tone at birth, which can lead to developmental delays and feeding difficulties.\n\n6. **Genetic Syndromes with Growth Retardation**: Such as Shwachman-Diamond Syndrome, which can present with growth retardation, hypotonia, and pancreatic insufficiency.\n\n7. **Microcephaly**: A condition where the head is smaller than average, often associated with developmental delays and intellectual disability.\n\n8. **Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS)**: Caused by prenatal exposure to alcohol, leading to developmental issues, growth retardation, and facial anomalies.\n\n9. **Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1)**: Characterized by multiple neurofibromas, learning disabilities, and delayed development.\n\n10. **Cystic Fibrosis (CF)**: While primarily affecting the lungs and digestive system, CF can also lead to developmental delays and growth issues.\n\nIt is important to note that this list is not exhaustive, and the actual diagnosis would require a comprehensive evaluation including genetic testing, metabolic screening, and other diagnostic procedures.",
