    "predict_diagnosis": "1. **Fetal Hydrops**: A condition where there is an abnormal accumulation of fluid in the fetus, which can lead to proteinuria and macroscopic hematuria.\n\n2. **Lupus Nephritis**: An autoimmune disease that can cause glomerulonephritis, leading to proteinuria and hematuria.\n\n3. **Membranous Glomerulonephritis**: A condition where the glomeruli are injured and thickened, leading to proteinuria and hematuria.\n\n4. **Polycystic Kidney Disease**: A genetic disorder that causes cysts to form in the kidneys, leading to kidney enlargement and potential dysfunction.\n\n5. **Renal Tubular Acidosis (RTA)**: A group of disorders that affect the kidneys' ability to maintain proper acid-base balance, which can lead to proteinuria and metabolic disturbances.\n\n6. **Infectious Mononucleosis**: A viral infection that can lead to symptoms like fever, sore throat, and lymphadenopathy, and potentially affect the kidneys.\n\n7. **Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS)**: A condition characterized by the destruction of red blood cells, kidney injury, and thrombocytopenia.\n\n8. **Dengue Fever**: A mosquito-borne viral infection that can cause systemic symptoms and affect the kidneys in severe cases.\n\n9. **Wegener's Granulomatosis**: An autoimmune disorder that can affect the kidneys and lead to glomerulonephritis, along with other systemic symptoms.\n\n10. **Cystinuria**: A genetic disorder that leads to the formation of cystine stones in the kidneys, which can cause urinary symptoms and lead to glomerulonephritis.\n\nThese diagnoses should be considered in the context of the patient's clinical presentation and further investigation, including laboratory tests and possibly kidney biopsy, would be needed to confirm the exact diagnosis.",
