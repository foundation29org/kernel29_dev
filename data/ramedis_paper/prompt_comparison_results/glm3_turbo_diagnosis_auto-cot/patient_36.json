    "predict_diagnosis": "1. **Myasthenia Gravis**: Characterized by muscle weakness and fatigue, particularly affecting the ocular muscles, leading to blurred vision and diplopia.\n\n2. **Oculomotor Neuron Disease**: A group of disorders affecting the oculomotor nerve, leading to impaired eye movement and muscle weakness.\n\n3. **Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome (LEMS)**: Caused by an autoimmune attack on the presynaptic neuromuscular junction, leading to muscle weakness and fatigability.\n\n4. **Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM)**: A progressive muscle wasting disease characterized by inflammation and fibrosis of the muscle fibers.\n\n5. **Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy (FSHD)**: An autosomal dominant disorder causing progressive muscle weakness and wasting, particularly affecting the facial, shoulder, and upper arm muscles.\n\n6. **Myotonic Dystrophy**: An autosomal dominant disorder characterized by an inability to relax muscles following contractions, leading to progressive muscle wasting and weakness.\n\n7. **Emery-Dreifuss Muscular Dystrophy (EDMD)**: An autosomal dominant disorder causing weakness and wasting of the shoulder, upper arm, and calf muscles.\n\n8. **Distal Muscular Dystrophy (DD)**: A group of disorders characterized by weakness and wasting of the muscles farthest from the center of the body, such as the hands and feet.\n\n9. **Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)**: A progressive neurodegenerative disease affecting the motor neurons, leading to muscle weakness and atrophy.\n\n10. **Metabolic Myopathies**: A group of disorders affecting the metabolism of muscle cells, leading to muscle weakness and fatigue.\n\nThese diagnoses should be considered in the context of the patient's medical history, family history, and results of further diagnostic tests such as muscle biopsy and genetic testing.",
