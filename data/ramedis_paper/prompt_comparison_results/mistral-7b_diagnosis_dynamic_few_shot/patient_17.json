    "predict_diagnosis": "   1. Mitral Valve Prolapse (MVP): This is a common structural heart defect where the mitral valve bulges into the left atrium.\n2. Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM): This is a type of restrictive heart muscle disease characterized by thickening of the heart muscle and impaired systolic heart function.\n3. Marfan syndrome: This is a genetic disorder that affects the connective tissue, causing cardiovascular and joint abnormalities.\n4. Aortic valve disease: This includes aortic stenosis, aortic regurgitation, and aortic valve prolapse.\n5. Heart failure: This is a condition where the heart is unable to pump blood efficiently to the body tissues.\n6. Aortic root aneurysm: This is a progressive dilation of the aortic root, leading to a risk of aortic dissection.\n7. Mitral regurgitation: This occurs when the mitral valve leaks and there is regurgitation of blood back into the atria.\n8. Kyphoscoliosis: This is an abnormal curvature of the spine in the thoracic region.\n9. Cardiomyopathy: This is a disorder of the heart muscle, leading to impaired cardiac function.\n10. Pulmonary hypertension: This is high blood pressure in the lungs, caused by a variety of conditions and leading to symptoms of dyspnea, exercising intolerance, and tachypnea.",
