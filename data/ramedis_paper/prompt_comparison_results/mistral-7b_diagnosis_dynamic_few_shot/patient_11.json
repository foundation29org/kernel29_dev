    "predict_diagnosis": "   1. McCune-Albright Syndrome: This is the most likely diagnosis given the patient's symptoms such as abnormal vagina morphology, abnormality of the breast, premature thelarche, ovarian cyst, and the finding of fibrous dysplasia in the long bones.\n2. Hyperparathyroidism: Elevated serum alkaline phosphatase concentration, accelerated skeletal maturation, and pain suggest hyperparathyroidism which may be associated with McCune-Albright Syndrome.\n3. Cushing's Syndrome: Elevated circulating free T3, accelerated skeletal maturation, and premature pubarche suggest Cushing's Syndrome which may be associated with McCune-Albright Syndrome or other underlying syndrome.\n4. Growth hormone excess: Elevated circulating growth hormone concentration and accelerated skeletal maturation suggest growth hormone excess which may be associated with McCune-Albright Syndrome.\n5. Thyroid dysfunction: Elevated circulating free T3, increased circulating thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) or decreased TSH, and decreased circulating luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) suggest thyroid dysfunction which may be associated with McCune-Albright Syndrome.\n6. Enlarged tonsils and adenoids: Enlarged tonsils and adenoids are frequently seen in McCune-Albright Syndrome.\n7. Polyostotic fibrous dysplasia: Multiple lesions are seen in McCune-Albright Syndrome, with one monostotic lesion at the clavicle and two polyostotic lesions at the long bones.\n8. Monostotic fibrous dysplasia: One monostotic lesion is seen at the clavicle, which is consistent with McCune-Albright Syndrome.\n9. Abnormality of the breast: Macroglossia is seen in McCune-Albright Syndrome and is seen in this patient.\n10. Ovarian cyst: Ovarian cyst is a common finding in women with McCune-Albright Syndrome.",
