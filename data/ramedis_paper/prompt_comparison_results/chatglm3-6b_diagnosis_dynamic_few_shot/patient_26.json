    "predict_diagnosis": "Based on the patient's symptoms and phenotype, the top 10 most likely diagnoses are:\n\n1. Urospinia - a condition characterized by symptoms such as urinary hesitancy, incontinence, and muscle weakness.\n2. Creatinine kinase (CK) elevation - which can be caused by muscle weakness, trauma, or infection.\n3. Pedal edema -swelling of the feet and ankles, which can be a symptom of heart failure, liver disease, or kidney disease.\n4. Amaurosis fugax - a temporary loss of vision, which can be caused by electrolyte imbalances, infections, or metabolic disorders.\n5. Hypertension - high blood pressure, which can lead to CK elevation and proteinuria.\n6. Renal disease - such as glomerulonephritis or nephrotic syndrome, which can cause proteinuria and edema.\n7. Valvular heart disease - including valvular heart failure, which can cause CK elevation and symptoms such as muscle weakness and exercise intolerance.\n8. Infections - such as urinary tract infections, which can cause symptoms such as hesitancy, incontinence, and pyuria.\n9. Autoimmune性疾病 -如自身免疫性肌炎,  which 可能引起肌肉无力, 尿道炎和蛋白尿等。\n10. Neonatal Marfan syndrome - a rare inherited disorder that affects the growth and development of blood vessels,骨骼, and heart, leading to hypertension and CK elevation.",
