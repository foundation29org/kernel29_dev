Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis\n6. Systemic lupus erythematosus (with renal involvement)\n7. ANCA-associated vasculitis (such as Wegener's granulomatosis)\n8. Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis\n9. Chronic kidney disease secondary to autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease\n10. Primary hyperoxaluria (with calcium oxalate kidney stones and renal damage) \n\nPlease note that the list is not exhaustive, and the actual diagnosis would require a thorough clinical evaluation, laboratory tests, and possibly renal biopsy to confirm the exact nature of the kidney disease. Additionally, the presence of sensorineural hearing impairment could suggest a syndromic condition that includes renal and auditory manifestations, such as Alport syndrome or certain genetic disorders.",
