    "predict_diagnosis": "1. Multiple System Atrophy (MSA), particularly the parkinsonian or cerebellar type, given the combination of autonomic, motor, and cerebellar symptoms.\n2. Parkinson's Disease with autonomic dysfunction, considering the bradykinesia, slurred speech, and urinary symptoms.\n3. Autonomic Dysfunction Syndrome, given the presence of nocturia, urinary hesitancy, and incontinence, along with other neurological signs.\n4. Spinal Cord Compression or injury, given the hyporeflexia, abnormal intervertebral disk morphology, and abnormal lumbar spine morphology.\n5. Peripheral Neuropathy, considering the paresthesia, impaired vibration and pain sensation, and abnormal reflexes.\n6. Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) with secondary autonomic and lower urinary tract symptoms.\n7. Diabetes Mellitus with neuropathy, given the history of diabetes and neurological symptoms like paresthesia and hyporeflexia.\n8. Hypogonadism-related cognitive and motor impairment, considering the male hypogonadism and memory impairment.\n9. Cerebellar Degeneration, given the broad-based gait, unsteady gait, and cerebellar signs like dyscalculia and Romberg sign.\n10. Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP), which can present with a similar clinical picture, including bradykinesia, falls, and gait abnormalities.",
