Cohen Syndrome\n\nEach of these conditions could present with a combination of the symptoms described, such as developmental delays, speech and language difficulties, neonatal hypotonia, and growth retardation. It is important to note that the presence of compulsive behaviors and an abnormal stomach morphology could suggest Prader-Willi Syndrome, while the elevated hemoglobin A1c might indicate insulin resistance, which can be associated with a range of genetic disorders. However, a precise diagnosis would require a thorough clinical evaluation, including genetic testing and other specialized investigations.",
