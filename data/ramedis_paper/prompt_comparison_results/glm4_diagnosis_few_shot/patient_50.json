Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), given the specific glomerular involvement and proteinuria.\n3. Membranous nephropathy, as it can present with proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, and tubulointerstitial fibrosis.\n4. Glomerulonephritis, considering the renal inflammation and glomerular involvement.\n5. Lipoid nephrosis (Minimal change disease), characterized by sparse scalp hair, hypoalbuminemia, and proteinuria.\n6. Dense deposit disease, which can cause proteinuria, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, and tubulointerstitial fibrosis.\n7. Nephrotic syndrome, given the combination of proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, and hypercholesterolemia.\n8. IgA nephropathy, as it can present with glomerulonephritis, fever, and sometimes proteinuria.\n9. Autoimmune tubulointerstitial nephritis, considering the tubular atrophy and pharyngeal abnormality.\n10. Renal amyloidosis, as it can lead to proteinuria, tubulointerstitial fibrosis, and foam cells in the kidney.",
