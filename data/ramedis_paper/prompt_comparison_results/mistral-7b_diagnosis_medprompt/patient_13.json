    "predict_diagnosis": "   1. Hyperparathyroidism: Abnormality of refraction, calcium deposition in bone, calcium deposition on skin and irregular margins of lesions could suggest this condition.\n2. Marfan syndrome: Refractive errors, visual loss, and cranial hyperostosis could be associated with this condition.\n3. Ehlers Danlos syndrome (EDS): Polyostotic fibrous dysplasia, abnormality of the occiput, and abdominal pain could point towards this condition.\n4. Fibrous Dysplasia of the Occipital Bone: Abnormal shape of the occiput and cranial hyperostosis could be characteristic of this condition.\n5. Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI): Refractive errors, abnormality of the occiput and cranial hyperostosis could be observed in this condition.\n6. Radiation Therapy-Induced Bone Changes: Abnormal refractive errors, calcium deposition on skin, and irregular margins of lesions could suggest this condition.\n7. Polylipemia: Visual loss, abdominal pain and hypocholesterolemia.\n8. Hypocalcemia: Cranial hyperostosis, irregular shape of the occiput, and refractive errors.\n9. Blepharitis: Anisocoria, visual loss, and eyelid symptoms could point towards this condition.\n10. Non-Syndromic Cranial Hyperostosis: Abnormal shape of the occiput and cranial hyperostosis could be observed in this condition.",
