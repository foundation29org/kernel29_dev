    "predict_diagnosis": "   1. Marfan Syndrome: Marfan syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects the connective tissue throughout the body. It is characterized by a tall stature, mitral valve prolapse, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, abnormal aortic valve morphology, mitral regurgitation, aortic regurgitation, tricuspid valve prolapse, left ventricular hypertrophy, dyspnea, aortic root aneurysm, kyphoscoliosis, tachypnea, back pain, exercise intolerance, tricuspid regurgitation, heart murmur, and chest pain.\n2. Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome: Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is a group of genetic disorders that affect the connective tissue. It is characterized by a tall stature, mitral valve prolapse, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, abnormal aortic valve morphology, mitral regurgitation, aortic regurgitation, tricuspid valve prolapse, left ventricular hypertrophy, dyspnea, aortic root aneurysm, kyphoscoliosis, tachypnea, back pain, exercise intolerance, tricuspid regurgitation, heart murmur, and chest pain.\n3. Dilated Cardiomyopathy: Dilated cardiomyopathy is a type of heart failure that causes the heart's chambers to enlarge and the heart muscle to weaken. It is characterized by a tall stature, mitral valve prolapse, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, abnormal aortic valve morphology, mitral regurgitation, aortic regurgitation, tricuspid valve prolapse, left ventricular hypertrophy, dyspnea, aortic root aneurysm, kyphoscoliosis, tachypnea, back pain, exercise intolerance, tricuspid regurgitation, heart murmur, and chest pain.\n4. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disorder that affects multiple organs in the body. It is characterized by a tall stature, mitral valve prolapse, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, abnormal aortic valve morphology, mitral regurgitation, aortic regurgitation, tricuspid valve prolapse, left ventricular hypertrophy, dyspnea, aortic root aneurysm, kyphoscoliosis, tachypnea, back pain, exercise intolerance, tricuspid regurgitation, heart murmur, and chest pain.\n5. Congenital Heart Disease: Congenital heart disease is a type of heart defect that is present at birth. It is characterized by a tall stature, mitral valve prolapse, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, abnormal aortic valve morphology, mitral regurgitation, aortic regurgitation, tricuspid valve prolapse, left ventricular hypertrophy, dyspnea, aortic root aneurysm, kyphoscoliosis, tachypnea, back pain, exercise intolerance, tricuspid regurgitation, heart murmur, and chest pain.\n6. Familial Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy: Familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a type of heart failure that affects multiple members of a family. It is characterized by a tall stature, mitral valve prolapse, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, abnormal aortic valve morphology, mitral regurgitation, aortic regurgitation, tricuspid valve prolapse, left ventricular hypertrophy, dyspnea, aortic root aneurysm, kyphoscoliosis, tachypnea, back pain, exercise intolerance, tricuspid regurgitation, heart murmur, and chest pain.\n7. Idiopathic Long QT Syndrome: Idiopathic long QT syndrome is a genetic disorder that causes the heart to beat too quickly. It is characterized by a tall stature, mitral",
