    "predict_diagnosis": "   1. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS): This disease can cause a combination of weakness and numbness in the arms and legs, as well as difficulty with fine motor skills, speech, breathing, and swallowing.\n2. Multiple system atrophy (MSA): This movement disorder can cause a combination of tremors, stiffness, balancing difficulties, gait abnormalities, and difficulty with coordination, as well as autonomic dysfunction, such as difficulty with regulating blood pressure and heart rate, bladder and bowel function, and sleep regulation.\n3. Parkinson's disease: This movement disorder typically causes a combination of tremors, stiffness, and slowness of movement, as well as difficulty with maintaining balance and gait, postural problems, and difficulty with coordination, but can also cause other symptoms such as depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbances.\n4. Friedreich's ataxia: This progressive neurological disorder can cause a combination of muscle weakness and stiffness, as well as difficulty with coordinating movements, especially ataxia (lack of coordination) of the gait and balance, and can also cause other symptoms such as hearing loss and peripheral demyelination.\n5. Hemolytic uremic syndrome: This disorder can cause a combination of anemia, kidney failure, and gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and abdominal pain.\n6. Hemolytic uremic syndrome with ataxia and sensorimotor neuropathy associated with anti-phospholipid syndrome (APS): This is a complication of APS that can cause a combination of anemia, kidney failure, gastrointestinal symptoms, as well as tremors, stiffness, numbness and tingling, difficulty with coordination, difficulty with gait, difficulty with facial symmetrical movements, and difficulty with swallowing.\n7. Hemolytic uremic syndrome with anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) antibodies: This is a complication of anti-GAD antibodies that can cause a combination of anemia, kidney failure, gastrointestinal symptoms, as well as tremors, stiffness, numbness and tingling, difficulty with coordination, difficulty with gait, difficulty with facial symmetrical movements, difficulty with swallowing, and abnormal brain MRI.\n8. Hemolytic uremic syndrome with anti-beta2 glycoprotein 1 ( anti-β2GP1) antibodies: This is a complication of anti-β2GP1 antibodies that can cause a combination of anemia, kidney failure, gastrointestinal symptoms, as well as tremors, stiffness, numbness and tingling, difficulty with coordination, difficulty with gait, difficulty with facial symmetrical movements, difficulty with swallowing, and abnormal brain MRI.\n9. Hemolytic uremic syndrome with anti-myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN)- Associated seronegative autoimmunity syndrome (ASA): This is a complication of anti-MPN ASA that can cause a combination of anemia, kidney failure, gastrointestinal symptoms, as well as tremors, stiffness, numbness and tingling, difficulty with coordination, difficulty with gait, difficulty with facial symmetrical movements, difficulty with swallowing, and abnormal brain MRI.\n10. Hemolytic uremic syndrome with anti-factor H antibodies: This is a complication of anti-factor H antibodies that can cause a combination of anemia, kidney failure, gastrointestinal symptoms, as well as tremors, stiffness, numbness and tingling, difficulty with coordination, difficulty with gait, difficulty with facial symmetrical movements, difficulty with swallowing, and abnormal brain MRI.",
